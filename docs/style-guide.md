# StartupAI Style Guide

## Design Philosophy

StartupAI embodies a **luxury, modern SaaS aesthetic** that communicates intelligence, calm, and execution clarity. The design prioritizes generous negative space, strong visual hierarchy, and architectural precision over decorative flourishes.

## Color System

### Light Backgrounds
- **Primary background**: Off-white (#fafaf8)
- **Secondary background**: Soft grey (#f5f5f3)
- **Card backgrounds**: White with hairline borders
- **Borders**: Light grey, minimal and intentional

### Dark Backgrounds
- **Dark sections**: Deep charcoal (#1a1a1a)
- **Text on dark**: Off-white (#fafaf8)
- **Borders on dark**: Dark grey (#333)

### Accent Colors (Green Only)
- **Primary accent**: Deep emerald green (#0d5f4e)
- **Secondary accent**: Sage green (#6b9d89)
- **Usage rule**: Green communicates growth, intelligence, and trust—never as decoration

The green accent system is used exclusively for:
- Primary call-to-action buttons
- Progress indicators and status markers
- Active states in timelines and workflows
- Hover states on interactive elements
- Strategic highlighting of key phrases

## Typography

### Typeface Hierarchy
- **Headlines (H1-H6)**: Elegant serif family (editorial confidence)
- **Body text**: Modern sans-serif (clarity and speed)
- **UI elements**: Sans-serif for buttons, labels, and navigation

### Type Scale & Usage
- **Hero headlines**: Large scale (5xl to 7xl), tight leading
- **Section headers**: Medium to large scale (4xl to 6xl)
- **Body paragraphs**: Generous leading for readability
- **Supporting text**: Subtle hierarchy with color weight

### Typography Principles
- Strong vertical rhythm throughout all sections
- Generous spacing between headline and body text
- Short, impactful headlines paired with concise supporting copy
- Avoid dense text blocks—prioritize breathing room

## Layout System

### Grid & Structure
- Maximum content width: 7xl container
- Consistent horizontal padding (6-8 on mobile, more on desktop)
- Section-based storytelling with clear beginnings and endings
- Responsive grid patterns: 2-column hero, 3-column cards, 4-column footer

### Spacing Philosophy
- Generous vertical padding between sections (32-40 on desktop)
- Internal component spacing uses a consistent scale
- Negative space is a design element, not empty space
- Clear visual separation between content zones

### Section Patterns
- Alternating light and dark backgrounds for rhythm
- Off-white and soft grey for primary content
- Dark sections for authority moments and final CTAs
- Each section serves one clear narrative purpose

---

## Component Patterns

### Cards
- White backgrounds with subtle grey borders
- No heavy shadows—prefer hairline borders
- Consistent padding and rounded corners (minimal radius)
- Hover states use border color changes, not dramatic effects

### Buttons
- Primary CTA: Deep emerald green with white text
- Secondary CTA: Transparent with grey border
- Subtle transitions on hover (color shifts, slight movement)
- Clear hierarchy between primary and secondary actions

### Icons
- Used sparingly and purposefully
- Circular backgrounds with green tint for feature cards
- Timeline nodes use solid green for active/complete states
- Lucide icon library for consistency

### Progress Indicators
- Horizontal bars with emerald green fill
- Subtle percentage labels in grey
- Full-width bars with rounded ends
- Used to show completion, not decoration

## Visual Principles

### Hierarchy
- Size, weight, and color establish clear information order
- One primary message per section
- Supporting details are understated, not competing
- Whitespace guides the eye through the narrative

### Contrast
- High contrast between light and dark sections
- Intentional use of color to direct attention
- Text contrast meets accessibility standards
- Subtle borders instead of heavy visual separation

### Motion & Interaction
- Transitions are smooth and understated (200ms standard)
- Hover states provide subtle feedback
- No aggressive animations or distracting effects
- Interactive elements are clearly afforded

## Content Strategy

### Messaging Tone
- Confident without arrogance
- Clear over clever
- Strategic, not tactical
- Founder-to-founder language

### Copy Length
- Headlines: 8-12 words maximum
- Supporting paragraphs: 2-3 sentences
- Card descriptions: Single, impactful sentence
- No unnecessary words

## Brand Expression

### What StartupAI Feels Like
