## Workflows

### Project Detail Load Workflow

**Trigger:** User navigates to project detail page

**Steps:**
1. System extracts project ID from route
2. Fetch project data from projects table
3. Fetch linked tasks from tasks table (filtered by project_id)
4. Calculate project progress from tasks
5. Assess project health status
6. Load team member profiles
7. Display project information
8. Display linked tasks
9. Render AI insights
10. Update right panel analytics

**Data Flow:**
- Route Parameter → Project ID
- Project ID → Supabase Query → projects table
