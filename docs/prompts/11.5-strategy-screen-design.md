5. AI analyzes trade-offs
6. AI provides recommendation with reasoning
7. AI generates action plan
8. Results displayed in main panel

**Analysis Process:**
- Step 1: Understand the decision (stakes, constraints, timeline)
- Step 2: Gather context (internal/external factors)
- Step 3: Identify options (3-4 strategic paths)
- Step 4: Analyze trade-offs (risk, reward, resources, time, reversibility)
- Step 5: Make recommendation (option + reasoning + assumptions)

**Configuration:**
