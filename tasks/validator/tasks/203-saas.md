### Core Questions Per Phase

| Phase | Core Question | Evidence Required |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1. Problem | Is the problem real and painful? | Customer interviews, pain intensity |
| 2. Market | Is the market large enough? | TAM/SAM/SOM, growth trends |
| 3. Customer | Who exactly is the buyer? | ICP definition, personas |
| 4. MVP | Does the solution work? | Activation, engagement, feedback |
| 5. Business Model | Will they pay? | Pre-orders, pricing validation |

---

## 6. Phase 1: Problem Validation

### Goal
Confirm you've identified a painful, urgent problem for a specific audience.

### Problem Validation Checklist

| Question | Good Answer | Red Flag |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Can you describe the problem in one sentence? | Clear, specific | Vague, broad |
| Who experiences this problem? | Specific role/industry | "Everyone" |
| How are they solving it today? | Workarounds, manual processes | No current solution attempts |
| How often do they encounter it? | Daily/weekly | Rarely |
| What's the cost of not solving it? | Quantifiable ($, time) | "Nice to have" |

### Methods to Validate Problems

1. **Search for complaints** — Reddit, Twitter, forums, G2 reviews
2. **Look for workarounds** — Spreadsheets, manual processes, email chains
3. **Check for competitors** — Competition = validated problem
4. **Conduct interviews** — 10-15 potential users minimum

### "Hair on Fire" Problem Indicators

| Indicator | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| Active seeking | Customers searching for solutions |
| Budget exists | Money already allocated for problem |
| Emotional language | Frustration, anger when discussing |
| Failed attempts | Tried other solutions, still unsatisfied |

### Market Viability Thresholds

| Metric | Minimum Target |
|--------|----------------|
| SOM | $1M ARR potential |
| Market growth | >10% annually |
| Market concentration | Not dominated by single player |

### Market Sizing Methods

| Method | Approach | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Top-down | Industry reports → segment % | Quick estimates |
| Bottom-up | # customers × average contract value | Accurate projections |
| Value theory | Cost of problem × willingness to pay | Premium positioning |

### Niche Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Vertical** | Focus on specific industry | CRM for financial advisors |
| **Horizontal** | Focus on specific role | Analytics for social media managers |
| **Sub-segment** | Specific use case within larger market | Email marketing for creators |

---

## 8. Phase 3: Customer Discovery

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Components

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Firmographics** | Industry, size, revenue, location | Series B fintech, 100-500 employees |
| **Role/Title** | Specific job function | Compliance Manager |
| **Goals** | What they need to achieve | Pass audits, maintain compliance |
| **Pain Points** | Obstacles to their goals | Manual reporting, 20+ hrs/month |
| **Watering Holes** | Where they spend time online | LinkedIn groups, industry forums |

### 5-Step Customer Discovery Process

| Step | Duration | Activity |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1. Formulate Hypotheses | 1-2 days | Define assumptions about customer, problem, solution |
| 2. Prospect & Outreach | 3-5 days | Identify 15-20 people fitting ICP |
| 3. Conduct Interviews | 1-2 weeks | 30-minute problem-focused conversations |
| 4. Synthesize Insights | 2-3 days | Identify patterns, recurring pains |
| 5. Iterate & Refine | Ongoing | Update ICP and hypotheses |

### Interview Best Practices

**The Mom Test Rule:** Ask about past behavior, not future intentions. People lie to be nice.

| ✅ Good Questions | ❌ Bad Questions |
|-------------------|------------------|
| "Tell me about the last time you..." | "Would you use a product that..." |
| "Walk me through how you handle..." | "Do you think this is a good idea?" |
| "What's the hardest part about..." | "Would you pay for..." |
| "How much time/money does this cost?" | "Is this useful?" |

### Affinity Mapping for Synthesis

1. **Extract** — Write every observation on sticky notes
2. **Group** — Cluster notes by emerging themes
3. **Name** — Label each cluster with core theme
4. **Prioritize** — Identify most common, emotional patterns

---

## 9. Phase 4: MVP Validation

### Landing Page Success Benchmarks

| Metric | Poor | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|------|-----------|
| Visitor → Signup | <2% | 5-10% | >10% |
| Signup → Paid Intent | <10% | 20%+ | >30% |
| Cost per signup | >$20 | <$10 | <$5 |

| Activation Rate | % completing key action | >40% |
| Engagement (DAU/MAU) | Frequency of return | >20% |
| Qualitative feedback | "Very disappointed" without product | >40% |

---

## 10. Phase 5: Business Model Validation

### Pricing Validation Methods

| Method | Description | Strength |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Pre-selling** | Charge before building | Gold standard — real commitment |
| **Van Westendorp** | Survey with 4 price questions | Identifies acceptable range |
| **Tiered mockups** | Good/Better/Best options | Reveals feature value perception |

### Van Westendorp Questions

1. At what price is it **too expensive**?
2. At what price does it seem **too cheap** (quality concern)?
3. At what price does it start to feel **expensive** but worth considering?
4. At what price is it a **bargain**?

### SaaS Pricing Models

| Model | Best For | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Per-user | Collaboration tools | $10/user/month |
| Usage-based | Variable consumption | $0.01/API call |
| Flat rate | Simple products | $49/month |
| Freemium | Viral potential | Free tier + paid upgrade |
| Tiered | Feature differentiation | Starter/Pro/Enterprise |

### Commitment Signals (Weakest → Strongest)

| Signal | Strength | Value |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Verbal interest | Very weak | Almost none |
| Email signup | Weak | Low |
| Time commitment | Moderate | Some |
| Paid pilot | Strong | High |

## 14. Common Mistakes

### Top Validation Pitfalls

| Mistake | Frequency | Impact | Prevention |
|---------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Building before validating | 70% | Months wasted, PMF delays | Landing pages, pre-sales, 50+ customer conversations |
| Underpricing | 55% | Unsustainable unit economics | Price on value, test 3x "comfortable" price |
| Ignoring churn | 60% | LTV collapse, growth stalls | Track cohort retention from day 1 |
| Serving everyone | 65% | Diluted positioning, slow sales | Pick narrow ICP, dominate, then expand |

### Red Flags in Validation

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| "Nice to have" | Not painful enough |
| Can't describe current workflow | Hypothetical problem |
| No prior solution attempts | Low urgency |
| Unwilling to schedule follow-up | Low interest |
| Won't pay anything | No real commitment |

### The "Build It and They Will Come" Fallacy

> The market is saturated with well-built software. Without validation, customers won't know you exist, and even if they find you, they may not care.

## 15. AI vs Traditional Validation

### Comparison Table

| Dimension | Traditional | AI-Powered |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Speed** | 4-8 weeks | Minutes |
| **Cost** | $5,000 - $25,000 | $0 - $200 |
| **Accuracy** | 54% | 89% |
| **Bias risk** | High (researcher dependent) | Low (data-driven) |
| **Scope** | Limited by time | Millions of data points |

### What AI Validation Provides

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Market Sizing | Instant TAM/SAM/SOM estimates |
| Competitor Analysis | Identify players, gaps, positioning |
| Customer Personas | Generate detailed ICPs |
| SWOT Analysis | Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats |
| Demand Prediction | Search volume, social sentiment |

### Best Practice: Hybrid Approach

1. **AI first** — Get rapid baseline analysis (80% of research)
2. **Manual second** — Validate with customer interviews (20% depth)
3. **Combine** — AI breadth + human insight = comprehensive validation

### Key Formulas

| Formula | Calculation | Target |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| LTV | ARPU × Customer Lifetime | Higher is better |
| CAC Payback | CAC ÷ (ARPU × Gross Margin) | <12 months |
| LTV:CAC | LTV ÷ CAC | >3:1 |
| Net Revenue Retention | (Start MRR + Expansion - Churn) ÷ Start MRR | >100% |

### Decision Framework

| Question | If YES | If NO |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Problem validated? | → Market research | → More interviews |
| Market large enough? | → Customer discovery | → Niche or pivot |
| ICP defined? | → Build MVP | → More discovery |
| MVP validated? | → Pricing validation | → Iterate MVP |
| Pricing validated? | → Scale | → Adjust model |
