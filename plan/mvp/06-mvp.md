A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the simplest, functional version of a startup idea that solves a core problem for early adopters to validate hypotheses with minimal investment. It enables maximum learning with the least effort, allowing for iterative improvements based on user feedback. 

Key Aspects of a Startup MVP
Core Functionality: Focuses on a single, crucial problem.
Validation Tool: Tests market demand and gathers user feedback early.
Iterative Process: Not a final product; it is the first step in a cycle of testing, learning, and refining.
Efficiency: Avoids unnecessary, time-consuming development of features that users may not want. 

Steps to Build an MVP
Define the Problem: Clearly identify the specific pain point to solve.
Identify Core Features: Select only the features essential to solve that problem.
Build and Launch: Release the product to early adopters, ideally in a short timeframe (e.g., within 3-5 days for critical updates).
Measure and Learn: Use analytics and direct feedback to understand user behavior.
Iterate: Refine, add features, or pivot based on validated learning. 

MVP Stage of Startup
We have our startups and know how limited budgets can be in the early days. That’s why the smartest way to start is with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) – the most basic version of your product that helps you test your ideas and collect user feedback.

What is an MVP phase meaning?

In this article, we will discuss the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and what is MVP startup, exploring its benefits, development process, and why it’s crucial for early-stage businesses.

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the simplest version of a product that can still deliver value to users. It includes only the core features necessary to satisfy early adopters and gather valuable feedback for future improvements. The goal of an MVP is to test a business idea with minimal resources and to validate its market potential before investing in a full-scale product.

Building an MVP allows startups to reduce time and costs while preserving the possibility for iteration. By releasing a product quickly, companies can observe real-world user behavior, collect data, and make informed decisions that align development with user needs. This approach minimizes the risk of failure by ensuring that the product being developed addresses genuine market demands.

The Lean Startup methodology for MVP in startups
The Lean Startup methodology is a framework developed by Eric Ries for developing businesses and products that prioritizes efficiency, learning, and adaptability. It revolves around the Build-Measure-Learn cycle:

1
Build

– develop a basic version of the product with core features.

2
Measure

– collect data on how users interact with the MVP.

3
Learn

– use feedback to refine the product and strategy.

This iterative process allows startups to pivot, change direction based on feedback, or persevere if the launch MVP is received positively. The focus is on experimentation and learning, minimizing waste by avoiding unnecessary features and maximizing customer value. This methodology encourages a culture of continuous improvement, essential for startups navigating the uncertainties of product development.

Key Elements in an MVP
The MVP should fit well with our business goals. Since it has limited features, we need to get a lot done with minimal effort and quickly. A launch MVP provides targeted solutions to particular user issues. A product owner or manager will create several user stories and epics as part of an Agile development strategy to tackle these problems. However, these user stories and epics do not fully capture their vision of the product or the business. To determine which features will maximize the MVP's impact effectively, a strategic and budget-conscious approach is necessary. Here are four essential elements that can guide us:

User Research

To truly understand our market and customers, we need to engage in thorough research and communicate directly with those interested. When we start noticing patterns in customer behavior, we can create customer profiles that help us announce the release of our MVP effectively.

This is also a crucial moment to gather as much information as possible about our Total Available Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM). Estimating the market cap can validate our business model's viability. Additionally, we should study our closest competitors and understand the influence they may have on us.

Competitive Analysis

There are various ways to conduct a competitive analysis. Approaching it from multiple angles will significantly help in identifying less obvious paths, allowing us to reduce resistance. Here are a few tips:

Identify

Identify our close competitors.

Understand

Understand their market positions (types, customer segments, niche strategies).

Develop

Develop a perceptual map featuring necessary attributes (like feature sets vs. pricing).

Review

Review customer experiences on their websites if we're targeting a similar audience.

Analyze

Analyze their pricing strategies. Keeping our prices near the low end of the supply elasticity can deter new competitors. The midpoint method for elasticity can help here.

Validate

Validate and test our distribution channels.

Review

Review customer feedback and observe their social media activities. If possible, investigate their advertising approaches.

Adaptability

In the early MVP stages of defining a product and its business context, our product development team is small enough to remain quite flexible. At this stage, the risks are low, the number of stakeholders is limited, and decisions can be made quickly. It can be leveraged by using Lean development principles with continuous integration and development (CI/CD). Every new improvement can be launched to the market, utilized by customers, and the feedback we receive can lead to beneficial changes. Essentially, ongoing iterations promote advancement.

Once our team grows beyond about 9-10 individuals, we’ll need to find ways to maintain that adaptability. The management approach, previously driven by the vision of the founders, must shift towards a mission-based perspective. This is because the specialization required for lean teams cannot rely solely on the founder's vision. A clear mission statement can guide multiple teams effectively, necessitating a review of the command structure.

Runway

Starting up a new business comes with various costs. These include expenses related to implementing the user stories and epics we’ve identified for the startup MVP stage, beginning with the most critical items:

Salaries and wages

Office equipment and furnishings

Insurance, liabilities, and patent costs

Administrative, legal, and financial consulting

Technical infrastructure and associated subscriptions

Depending on the type and amount of funding available, we may not always have enough resources to sustain the business until launch day. This is a crucial factor in determining the feasibility of the entire project. Effectively managing expenses to allocate funds carefully will be vital for extending our runway, ensuring that we achieve sufficient momentum for the product to succeed.

Types of Minimum Viable Products
There are several ways to approach creating a minimum viable product (MVP). In other words, minimum and viable can be defined in various ways. Let’s explore some of the most recognized methods.

Landing Page
This is a straightforward website that outlines what the product offers and is designed to measure interest. It often features a call-to-action, like signing up for a newsletter or pre-ordering, to assess demand.

Wizard of Oz
This kind of product seems fully automated, but is actually operated manually behind the scenes. It allows for testing the product's features without the need for complex automation systems.

Concierge
With this method, the business provides the service manually rather than through automated solutions. This approach enables refinement of the service based on direct interactions with users.

Piecemeal
This version employs existing tools and services to bring a product to market, rather than building everything from the ground up. By using third-party platforms, businesses can test market interest before committing to custom development.

Single Feature
This approach concentrates on one primary feature rather than a complete product suite. It helps startups validate the most crucial part of their concept before scaling.

Email
This involves launching an email campaign targeting potential users to measure their interest and gather feedback prior to a full product launch.

Prototype
A visual or interactive representation of the product is created to showcase its features and obtain initial feedback.

What are some startup MVP examples?
If you are wondering what this would look like in practice, let’s look at some of the most popular brands that launched MVP in start-ups effectively:

Facebook – Mark Zuckerberg first developed Facebook for the Harvard University students in the year 2004 with the aim of making it a small social networking site. It was once a small website called “TheFacebook”, which was designed to connect students with each other. The MVP helped Zuckerberg to validate the idea, as the application started on Harvard’s campus only and then reached other Ivy League schools, the majority of universities in the United States, and finally the public. Gathering people’s feedbacks and consistently updated features, Facebook gradually becomes the world’s largest social media platform with more than 3 billion users, and revolutionized people’s behavior of communicating and interacting in the digital space.

Today, this company appeared as the result of student’s dream, when Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to find the ways to pay the rent in San Francisco. In 2007, they established an MVP using AIR bed and this they began taking beds in their own apartment and rented out to conference attendees at cheaper rates than hotels. Confirming the existence of high demand for short-term peer-to-peer accommodations, they created the website through which hosts could offer their homes. By repeating the users’ feedback and adjusting the model, Airbnb became a multi-billion company that changed the perceptions on travelling and hosting globally.

He finally decided to start with a bookstore, since he thought it was the minimum viable product that he could create and bring to life from his garage. His successful bookstore resulted to the necessity of more things such as electronic goods, fashion apparels, and shoes. It was his first strategic move of employing books as the minimum viable product that helped to offer him customer insight to enter the next level of Amazon. Unbelievable as it must sound, today Amazon was a small bookstore on what could be referred to as a basic webpage at the start of the year 2000, and today it ranks the third-largest enterprise in the entire world.

Uber – the application for finding transport – is not actually an application which began its journey in this format. Furthermore, the co-founders, Garret Camp and Travis Kalanick, the notion of an MVP to create an iPhone-only SMS service called UberCab in San Francisco. So, they first tested the user and conditioned it to the city and only when they managed to attract venture capitalists; they built the application through which they provide 19 million trips every single day. Uber has evolved through different levels of service development and expanded its operations year after year based on the information received from the customers. Uber initially started with taxis under UberCab, but during its second expansion, it shifted to black cars and independent contractors, transforming into the ride-sharing platform most people use today. This evolution happened during its app-stage, allowing Uber to refine its service model.

How your startup can benefit from an MVP
If your MVP is done through a website or application, we may gain some crucial information on behavior and demand. This valuable information becomes so important when it comes to soliciting money from investors, it improves the chances of its getting the green light. 

Benefits of an MVP 
Faster time-to-market

Early brand awareness

Lower development risks

Competitive edge through quick updates

Chance to experiment in different revenue streams

Validation of real-world performance

More effective use of resourcesrve

Focusing on an MVP has its advantages, as its primary purpose is to provide a method for committing as low an amount of funding as possible – several hundreds or even tens of thousands of dollars at most. Defining an MVP budget can help to save money, acquire critical information regarding consumer preferences, enter the market rapidly, and attract early investors if any. The feedback and funding that you receive at this stage will help you in defining the scope of the product lifecycle management that will lead to the product consumers want and need.

Several questions to ask before working on the MVP stage of a startup
It is critical to set down the basic framework first that can guarantee that work aligns with the user's and business objectives to avoid plunging directly into product development. By developing a comprehensive plan right from the beginning, one will be in a position to avoid further problems of time, money, and energy in the future.

Below, you can find some tips to consider ensuring before you start product:

A Defined Problem Statement
In order to aim the product towards the right target market and to be able to have an effective product direction, it is crucial to identify the main problem you want to solve. Statement of a problem is useful in that it assists in focusing on the objectives to be achieved.

User Research 
Surveys will help you establish your target audience and their proclivity to certain behaviors, likes and issues they are likely to encounter. Understanding your user base is useful in determining how your product should look and function for the target consumers.

A Conceptual Vision
Imagine your product and envision it in action to meet the needs of the users. This will help in the development process to come up with a product that is inline with the set objectives.

Setting up an effective MVP
The creation of an MVP in startups is about delivering the core value of a product without investing too much in the development, to enable you to understand the market response. When building a product, having a well-structured MVP helps you to accumulate key knowledge, work on improving and developing the offering and create a basis for subsequent development.
Below is how best to set up an MVP budget:

Define Success Metrics
For this purpose, decide on specific KPIs that will have to be met to define the success of the MVP, such as user conversion rates or level of engagement. These KPIs will help you evaluate if the MVP serves its purpose and will be useful in further development.

Iterate Based on Feedback
Ensure that the user feedback and interaction data is collected and assessed frequently to enhance the product. In this way, by paying attention to several requirements customers might have, improvements can be focused towards the direction of creating an MVP that is much closer to their expectations.

Maintain Simplicity
This way, the user interface must remain simple, which contributes to presenting only the most essential features of the MVP. Estimate development time MVP carefully to ensure efficiency and avoid unnecessary delays. DO NOT add many functions to the product at this stage – this might lead to confusion and unnecessary complexity on the part of a user.

Plan for Growth
Ensure your MVP stage is as simple as possible, but create the architecture so that expansion in the future is easy when implementing new features based on user feedback, among the options below, which do not represent all the possibilities. This makes it easy to develop the product as the usage grows due to changes in the user needs.

Launch and Learn
When the MVP comes out, simply observe how it is doing and be prepared to change things as soon as you hear from the audience. It is also important for checking whether the possibilities meet the real needs and adapting the product in order to better meet user requirements.

Summary
The Minimum Viable Product is important for any start-up company that wants to enter a new market sustainably and get to know its customers’ needs. To that end, Lean Startup methodology and customer development can reduce the risk of developing unsuccessful products, while getting feedback from actual customers allows the startup to refine its product to fit the market’s demands. An MVP also helps know what else can be added in the future while providing a platform for growth and development out of an idea and a concept present with the aim of being a business.

📜 DEEP DIVE
Y-Combinator's Framework for Building a Successful MVP.
When it comes to building a startup, one of the things that comes to a founder’s mind is creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to test whether their solution to a particular problem is valid or not. However, one of the common mistakes I observe founders making is forgetting about the "Viable" part and just focusing on the product.

This common mistake is observed in 90% of startup founders and the rest 10% of founders who know how to build MVP become startups like Airbnb, twich & stripe etc.

Also, most of the founders mistaken the meaning of MVP - that it’s about considering one feature and building a product. Actually - It’s more than that!

So - In this, we will deep dive into -

Real Meaning of Building Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

How did Airbnb, Twitch, and Stripe build their MVPs?

How did these startups use the Y-Combinator MVP building strategy?

How can you build the MVP for your startup?

So grab your coffee and let’s deep dive into it!

What is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers …— Wikipedia

What should be your MVP mindset In the Pre-Launch Stage?




Source: Y-Combinator
Let’s start with the meme above. It’s called the midwit meme.

Many first-time founders (the guy to the left of the bell curve) launch quickly and iterate (continue launching quickly). This is the same for the expert founder (the guy to the right of the bell curve).

But the guy in the middle is the “smart founder”. Let’s call him Benny. Benny wants to do surveys, raise money, build a team, etc. He wants to do it all. Benny learns after a while he should have been like the “dumb guys”.

As a founder, you want to build an MVP, get it to customers, and learn if it helps them or not. Then iterate.

You only really start learning about your users when you put a product in front of them. Not by doing 1000 surveys, gathering a mailing list, or fundraising for half a year.

The amazing thing, your MVP might not even work how you want it to.

Your goal as an early-stage founder:

Launch quickly. (MVP)

Get your first customers.

Talk To Customers & Get Feedback

Iterate (Improve the product)

These goals need to be your guiding principle.

Expect that after 3–5 iterations, your MVP would have changed so much. But that’s a good thing. It means you’ve been listening to your customers.

Try and remember that you are not the hero of your customer’s story. You’re not Harry Potter, you’re Dumbledore who gives him the tools to be the hero of his own story. You serve at the pleasure of the customer.

Is an MVP really the way to go?

Many founders want to build a product (like the iPhone) that blows people out of the water at once. That’s a very steep hill to climb though.

The MVP approach is best. You might have a question that -

But What If My MVP Is Rubbish and they Never Want To Talk To Me Again?

Even the biggest startups had this same fear. YC deals with it every time. It’s okay that you feel this fear. But never act on it.

FEAR- False Expectations Appearing Real

Think about it. If one customer doesn’t like your product, does that kill your startup? No. You can reach out to another customer. You can reach out to the same customer after you’ve made the product better.

The more amazing thing is that most people who speak with startups at an early stage are early adopters. They try out products that are in their rubbish phase. They are used to products not working quite as well as they should.

Early users usually have a problem. They are the only ones brave enough to try untested products that could solve the problem. They are usually there for the long haul to give you feedback on how to make the product better.

Fake Steve Jobs -

These types of founders think they know exactly what the customer needs. Let’s call them fake Steves.

In their minds, Steve Jobs built the iPhone and iPod, such amazing products in one go. The mistake they're making is that’s not true. Many of them remember the 3rd or 4th iteration of these products. The first iPhone had 2G internet, no app store, etc.

You don’t know what the customer needs. The customer alone knows what they need. If you ask them, they will tell you. How you ask them is by showing them your MVP.

Examples of Successful MVPs

1. Airbnb:




Source: Y-combinator
This is the first version of AirBnB. They didn’t have a lot of features. If you were an early adopter, here was what you enjoyed.

No payment system.

No map view. You couldn’t see where the house was in the city.

You had to sleep on an airbed. The whole house could not be rented to you.

It was only for conferences.

2. Twitch:

Twitch was the world's leading video platform and community for gamers.




Source: Y-combinator
They began as Justin TV with one page.

Only 1 streamer, Justin.

Their video was low res.

But they’re now one of the most popular streaming websites in the world.

Do you know what thing they focused on at the pre-launch stage?

Software MVP

Very fast to build (weeks not months)

Very limited functionality

Appeal to a small set of users

They built a product that people loved, not one that everyone loved. It didn’t solve all the problems. Solve problems step by step.

Who Are These Early Adopters? Why Do They Want To Go Through So Much Pain?

“You want to build your product for customers who have their hair on fire.” What product would you want to buy from me?

Maybe a hose, bucket of water, or something that can bring water. Well, all I have is a brick (my MVP). Walking away won’t even cross your mind. You’re desperate, you’ll buy the brick and hit yourself on the head to kill the fire.

The early adopters are the desperate ones. Forget the ones that are not desperate.

Why surveys don’t work.

You might have had a formal business school education. Now you’re thinking let’s do a survey and learn everything the user needs. Then we build it.

That won’t work either. The customer doesn’t know everything about the answer to their problem. They don’t even know everything about the problem itself. If they did, don’t you think they would build the solution on their own or hire people to do it for them?

It’s your job to know. Surveys help you find out your users' pain but not how to solve it. Only a product can do that.

You give them a product and ask, does this solve your problem? Yes or no and
you go down the scientific method flow chart from there.




How To Build An MVP Quickly!

Set a specific deadline for completion.

Give yourself a timeframe. It’s easier to move on if you do. If you allow endless time to build, you’ll never stop building the MVP.

Write down the MVP features.

Don’t keep doing a double take while building. Write everything you want to build down now. Then you won’t have to rethink everything later.

Cut unnecessary features.

At this point, you will cut many features. Think how important is this to solve the user’s problem.

A startup to solve overseas payments doesn't need a chat feature in the MVP. Neither does it need APIs connected to every bank in the world. Both are important but can be skipped for the MVP.

Don’t fall in love with your MVP.

Have you heard married couples say something like: this is not the person I married or fell in love with?

Please please please don’t fall in love with your MVP.

It will change so much as you’re iterating.

If you’re in love with it, you won't want it to change. You’re building an emotional barrier to your growth.

Final Thoughts

“It’s better to have 100 customers that really love your product than 100k that are just ok with it.” — Michael Seibel, Y-Combinator

Those 100 will give you rich feedback that you need to grow. Build for them and the others will come when you have a shiny product.

All these concepts are covered in the Video by Michael Seibel!

• High-ticket B2B: First Principles, Awareness Levels, Moat Thinking
• Content/influencer: Psychographics, Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature

Return the sections below. Label a section with the framework used if helpful (e.g., “(JTBD)” or “(Awareness: Problem-aware)”). Be clear, concise, and non-customer-facing.

• Demographics (only if decision-relevant): age/role/income/industry/location
• Psychographics: beliefs, values, aspirations, fears, identity drivers (who they want to become)
• Core frustrations: what they want to stop feeling/doing/struggling with
• Primary goals: outcomes, progress, or emotional relief they actively seek
• Current alternatives: what they use today (including workarounds or “do nothing”)
• Resonant messaging: tone/promises/insights that land; the beliefs or objections we must shift

Avoid repeating product features. Focus entirely on the customer. Close with a short “Teach me” note on why these choices matter.
Prompt 4 — three value propositions under 20 words

Purpose: make the promise crisp and believable. Copy-paste:

Write 3 value propositions under 20 words each:

We help [AUDIENCE] go from [BEFORE STATE] to [AFTER STATE] using [PRODUCT].

Use the modular logic that fits:
• SaaS or B2B services: Hormozi’s value equation (dream outcome vs. friction), April Dunford positioning (Alternative → Unique → Value), Awareness Levels (Problem/Solution-aware)
• DTC/brand-led: Brand Archetypes, Empathy Map + Emotional Ladder, Blair Warren persuasion triggers
• High-ticket B2B/consulting: First Principles (pain → path → belief shift), Andy Raskin narrative (enemy → promised land), Hormozi objections
• Creator/influencer: Tribal logic (“people like us…”), identity shift, StoryBrand clarity (hero meets guide)

Ensure emotional clarity, outcome specificity, and believability. End with a brief “Teach me” note.
Prompt 5 — pick a defensible wedge vs competitors

Purpose: find a clear, ownable position with proof. Copy-paste:

Competitors (add if you have them):
[Competitor 1], [Competitor 2], [Competitor 3]
Websites:
[URL 1], [URL 2], [URL 3]

Analyse each competitor’s homepage and core product messaging. Summarise:
• Primary value prop (headline + implied promise)
• Likely axis of competition (e.g., speed, price, power, simplicity, brand)
• Who they’re really speaking to (persona insight)

Then propose 3 positioning axes that are unclaimed or under-leveraged. Return a table:

| Axis | Emotional benefit | Who it’s for | How to prove |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [e.g., Simplicity at scale] | [Control, calm, clarity] | [Teams with tool fatigue] | [One dashboard; one prompt; full funnel] |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

Close with: “Of these 3, lead with [X] because [strategic rationale].”
Bonus: include a sharp one-liner to communicate this wedge. End with a “Teach me” note.
Prompt 6 — choose the GTM mode

Purpose: align go-to-market with structure, not vibes. Copy-paste:

Enter GTM Mode Selector. Use prior outputs (market, pricing, positioning, TAM, growth, CAC, wedge).

My product:
[Insert if single product]

Answer:
1) Most viable GTM mode: Steal, Expand, Defend, or Stimulate
2) Strategic rationale (structural, not tactical): why this mode fits margins, market shape, and model
3) Optimise for:
   • Speed vs margin?
   • Awareness vs conversion?
   • Breadth vs depth of messaging?
4) Modes I should not pursue—and why
5) GTM difficulty (1–10) with blind spots

Do not recommend specific tactics yet. End with a “Teach me” note.
Decision rules (kill or keep)

Kill if growth is flat/declining, saturation is high, or the wedge is trivial.

Kill if CLV (customer lifetime value) can’t support CAC (customer acquisition cost) at 3:1 within 6–12 months.

Kill if pricing ceiling leaves unsustainably low margins after COGS (cost of goods sold) + discounts.

Proceed if there’s a provable wedge, at least one efficient channel with viable CAC, and a path to repeatable revenue.

Good output looks like

Crisp numbers with sources or reasoned estimates

Competitor reads that reveal the true audience

Value props sceptics would believe

A wedge provable in product/experience

A defendable Go / No-Go call

Pro tips

Bring one edge metric (COGS, CPC, or baseline conversion) to anchor the math

Ask for ranges/sensitivity if early (e.g., “show outcomes if CPC is +30%”)

Reddit marketing for B2B saas founders: a step-by-step guide.
If you’re a B2B SaaS founder and not leveraging Reddit, you’re leaving leads on the table.

I recently came across the Reddit Marketing Guide by Adam Shaw, so I thought to share with you some key points and my opinion with you. He shared, “Reddit is the #2 source of leads, right after LinkedIn. It’s where people are actively asking for help and exploring new solutions—unlike LinkedIn, which is more about storytelling and sharing success.

And here’s the kicker: 50% of my leads come from just answering questions on Reddit for less than an hour a day.”

Here’s how you can do it

Step 1: Turn Your Profile into a Landing Page

Your Reddit profile is like a mini landing page. It’s the first place curious users will go after reading your comments or posts. Make sure it’s optimized to convert.




How to set it up:

Choose a username that’s tied to your brand or product.

Write an actionable profile name (e.g., “Helping SaaS Founders Scale”).

Add a CTA to your profile banner (e.g., “Download our Free SaaS Marketing Guide”).

Include your one-line product pitch and CTA in the bio (e.g., “We help SaaS founders grow faster. Subscribe to our newsletter below!”).

Add links to key resources like:

Lead magnets

Newsletter sign-ups

Product demo

Step 2: Find Subreddits Where Your Audience Hangs Out

Reddit is vast, but your audience is likely concentrated in a handful of niche subreddits.




How to find them:

Use Reddit’s search bar to look for your product keywords (e.g., “SaaS,” “startup growth,” etc.).

Use Google to search for “your keywords + Reddit” (pro tip: Google is better at finding Reddit threads than Reddit itself).

Pick subreddits with active, engaged members in your niche.

Pro tip: Use tools like Gummy Search to automate finding relevant subreddits and posts.

Step 3: Prepare a Lead Magnet

Redditors hate being sold to. They love value first approaches.

That’s where a lead magnet comes in. It’s a way to engage your audience without coming across as too salesy.'

Examples of great lead magnets:

In-depth guides tailored to specific problems.

Free trials of your product.

Newsletters with actionable advice (my favorite).

Make it easy for people to commit. For example, I use a newsletter landing page to capture leads. By the time they get there, I’ve already built trust through helpful comments.

Step 4: Start by Commenting, Not Posting

Engage first, post later.

Why? Comments are more personal and allow you to directly connect with people asking for help. You’ll also learn what your audience really needs.

How to comment like a pro:

Answer recent posts (24-48 hours old) for better visibility.

Avoid crowded posts (0-10 comments is the sweet spot).

Add value. Most comments are generic—stand out by being actionable, specific, and helpful.

Step 5: Be the Best Commenter

The secret to success on Reddit? Write better comments than everyone else.

Here’s how:

Be highly relevant—answer only what’s asked.

Be specific—don’t just say “try this.” Explain how to try it.

Go in-depth—assume the person has zero knowledge.

Stay friendly—ignore trolls.

Make your comment stand out visually too:

Use white space for readability.

Add bullet points to organize your thoughts.

Be longer than most comments (Reddit loves thoughtful responses).

Step 6: Post to Curate Conversations

Once you’ve spent a few weeks commenting, you’ll notice patterns in what your audience talks about. That’s when you start posting.

But don’t make the mistake of being self-serving. Redditors can smell that a mile away.

Here’s what works:

Don’t post a blog or self-promo content. Instead, ask questions that spark engagement.

Let the audience share their thoughts and experiences in the comments.

Use their responses to build conversations and authority naturally.

Reddit can be a goldmine for B2B SaaS founders if used the right way. Focus on engagement first, provide value, and let the leads come to you.

If you’re building a startup, you either have an amazing idea of a product or service you feel the world needs, or you want to make money. Those two are intertwined 99% of the time. So, basically, you want a hero story.

In the startup world, however, no hero story is possible without speed. The race to attract investors and outpace competition has never been fiercer. Venture capital isn’t waiting around for you to build a perfect product, either.

PROMOTED

With the release of new generative AI (GenAI) models, founders are increasingly using them to generate code. According to Y Combinator, one-quarter of the startups of the W25 batch relied on AI to generate 95% of their codebases.

The AI-Powered MVP Revolution
GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT and AI-assisted integrated development environments (IDEs) make it possible to build in a weekend what once required a whole quarter to complete. If you’re a founder, it feels like you’re finally operating at the speed that matches your ambition.

But here’s the part most founders discover the hard way: Speed alone doesn’t produce an investable product. Many AI-built minimum viable products (MVPs) look exciting but fall apart under real user load. So, instead of trying to make AI build an MVP for them, successful startups save both time and cost by letting a dedicated team do just that (with the help of AI, of course).

Here’s a real-world statistic for you: At MobiDev, we applied a rapid MVP development strategy boosted with AI to create CRM software and launch it a whopping 7.5 times faster than what's considered industry standard. Saving 76% of the budget at the same time speaks for itself.

Why Vibe Coding Alone Fails
In short, AI isn't yet powerful enough to consider all the aspects of software architecture to build a solid product. There are many cases discussed on X and Reddit about how vibe coding failed companies of different sizes, making the founders’ lives harder.

There’s also the security angle. A recent case described on the Pivot to AI blog shows how dangerous vibe coding can get. A vibe-code-built system, NX, was compromised, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that stole the creators’ crypto.

This means that human expertise is irreplaceable in steering AI and delivering production-grade code.

The AI-As-Partner Model
Here’s where things get interesting. The real magic is in pairing AI with a strong human feedback loop.

The biggest shift I’ve seen at MobiDev with GenAI is this: AI is no longer only a tool. It’s a teammate. But like any teammate, it needs structure, direction and someone senior enough to step in when it goes off the rails. That’s why our workflow looks less like prompt → pray → ship and more like a five-step co-creation system designed to keep speed and sanity intact.

1. Context Creation And Prep
Before a single line of AI-generated code lands in the repository, we load the models with deep project context, like architecture decisions, constraints, domain knowledge, edge cases and user goals.

2. Multimodel Workflow With Iterative Checks
No single large language model (LLM) sees the whole picture. Different models handle different tasks—architecture scaffolding, code generation, documentation and testing, for example—and then cross-check each other’s output.

3. Results Verification And Rollback Options
Every AI-generated change runs through automated verification. If something looks off, we rollback instantly and regenerate the segment instead of patching over mistakes.

4. Final Validation With Performance And Security Audits
When speed is the goal, security can’t be an afterthought. Before anything goes live, humans take over again, reviewing logic, load behavior, data flows, API durability and the security posture.

5. Expert-In-The-Loop Governance
At every step, a senior engineer oversees the process, guiding the AI, checking reasoning, validating architecture choices and shutting down shortcuts that could lead to technical debt. The AI moves fast, but the expert ensures it moves correctly.

Together, these steps make AI a force multiplier rather than a liability. You get the speed founders crave, without the “We need to rewrite everything” nightmare that kills so many promising MVPs before they meet an investor.

Speed Without Sacrifice: Balancing Fast And Fundable
Speed without guardrails is the biggest reason AI-built MVPs get rejected by investors. When validation is skipped, founders end up with brittle prototypes that look good in demos but collapse during technical due diligence. No traction, no trust, no funding.

AI tools can dramatically boost development speed when used as assistants, not autopilots. The key is to keep humans in control. Verify outputs, challenge assumptions and audit critical components.

Fast is good. Fast and correct is fundable.

Practical Advice For Startups In 2026
1. Select your AI tools wisely. Don’t chase the hype of the newest AI model. You must choose what fits your needs. Better yet, ask for advice from tech experts who have a proven track record of using different AI models for different tasks.

2. Data security is something your investors are going to ask about right away. Private contexts, self-hosted models and zero-leakage workflows are quickly becoming the default. You'll get more praise for reasonably handling AI in a secure, privacy-first way.

3. Sure, AI can ship features at warp speed. But without human oversight and a plan, you end up with a product that works, but only in a technical sense. A roadmap and regular feedback are what turn an interesting experiment into an actual business.

Conclusion
Building a startup has always been a hero’s journey. You start with ambition, pressure and a narrow window to prove you matter. What’s changed is the toolset. AI can now compress months of work into weeks, but only if it’s used with intent.

When professionals guide AI, it stops being a risky shortcut and becomes a strategic advantage.

With precise, expert use of AI, nothing stands between you and a successful MVP. The race is still about speed, but the winners are the ones who build smart, stay fundable and turn momentum into a real business. Your hero journey is calling.

 What is MVP in a startup?
For as long as there have been products and people — or teams — making them, companies have struggled with issues like productivity, efficiency, performance and competition. Today, every startup company in existence needs to deal with finding the right problem to solve and the right market to sell it. And they need to do it fast and well. Up to nearly a decade ago, they would do it with heavy product management, following a top-down — or waterfall — approach. Things changed with the introduction of Lean Startup. These types of goals are much better served using an MVP approach.

What is MVP in a startup?
An MVP (Minimum Viable Product), contrary to a fully specified product followed by a waterfall type of product management, can liberate founders from having to develop the entire thing before learning if customers need it, find it easy or are willing to pay for it. Notwithstanding that, an MVP is not easy to produce. Understanding what it is and what purpose it needs to serve will help avoid common pitfalls or misunderstandings regarding the direction to take in developing it.

What is an MVP and why do you need it?
History has it that tech CEO Frank Robinson coined the term in 2001, advocating that customer research and product development should happen in tandem, for a product to succeed.

Eric Ries described the term in 2011, in his book “The Lean Startup”. An MVP, short for Minimum Viable Product, is a free-standing product. One that can stand with the minimum number of features, solving the one, most important problem for the customers it’s supposed to serve. But it does need to solve it well, without causing other problems in the process.

Definition
According to Eric Ries, an MVP is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.

In other words, it’s not supposed to start making money. It’s actually there to help understand how to develop a process — or SOP — to make money.

Why a Minimum Viable Product?
Typically, startup companies tend to look for funding, to help cover the expenses of developing their product. But first, they need to test their idea and assumptions over what it is their target audience needs and what resonates with them. And the fastest way is to develop a minimal product with the least amount of effort and minimal budget.

Of course — and this is not a side effect, but by design — this gives a startup company the opportunity to release a product (a version of it) to the market, really quickly. Perhaps, even allowing them the benefit of being the first to reach a specific market or market type. However, this type of benefit is, oftentimes, overpriced. Crudely put, it largely depends on the type of product and business model.

The main goal of a Minimum Viable product is to collect knowledge and validate assumptions in the business model. Knowledge is the currency the entire company will be using until they can learn all they need towards a viable business model. That’s what it’s all about, after all; a healthy, viable business.

The alternative to that is to develop a minimum product that people will just love. And as Sam Altman from Y Combinator indicates:

It’s better to build something that a small number of users love than a large number of users like.

The Lean Startup methodology
The Lean Startup methodology is a derivative of the Lean manufacturing process, developed for the Toyota Production System, pioneered by Taiichi Ohno, om 1951.

In 2005, Steve Blank supported the notion that this style of product management can be translated to software development, to be used by tech companies. And, he described all about it in his book, “The four steps to the Epiphany”. In 2011, Eric Ries set things in motion with his book, “The Lean Startup”, motivating a number of startups to begin experimenting with the model.

The Lean Startup methodology aims to minimize or eliminate wasted effort, promoting value-producing practices. In other words, the goal is to eradicate the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end-customer. It’s based on three pillars; a three-aspect model named Build-Measure-Learn. In short, a startup company can build a minimal product, with the minimum effort and budget, measure the results by testing and validating their assumptions and using their conclusions to build something better. The process repeats with iterations of improvement, building a robust business model.

4 key elements in an MVP
The MVP should align with business objectives. And, given its nature, including the limited functionality, a lot needs to be achieved with the least amount of work; and fast. An MVP offers specific solutions to specific user problems. To deal with them, a product owner or manager will develop a series of user stories, epics, components, as per some type of Agile development. These user stories and epics are not representative of their vision of the product — or the business, for that matter. To choose which functionality will help the most in getting the most out of the MVP, one must be strategic and frugal. To that end, there are 4 key elements to help:

1. User research
Understanding one’s market and customers involves extensive research and direct communication with interested parties. Once a pattern emerges in customer behavior, we can draft a customer profile, which will help build a way to communicate the release of our MVP when the time comes. 

This is also the point in time when we need to find all we can about our Total Available Market (TAM), our Serviceable Available Market (SAM) and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM). A market cap estimate is always useful in validating the viability of our business model. Learning all we can about our close competitors and the forces they can exercise upon us won’t hurt, either.

2. Competitive analysis
There are many different ways to conduct competitive analysis; or different fronts, rather. A multi-faceted approach will greatly help identify the path less travelled and take it to minimize resistance. Here are a few considerations:

Identify close competitors
Identify their positioning (market types, customer segments, longtail approach, niches)
Create a perceptual map with the attributes you need (e.g. feature-set vs pricing)
Review the customer experience on their websites if you’re after the same type of audience
Look at their pricing. It helps if you minimize the chances of new players joining the game, by staying at the low end of price elasticity of supply. The midpoint method for elasticity can help with that
Identify, verify and test your distribution channels
Go over customer reviews and social media presence. Additionally, try to find what types of ads they’re running, if possible
3. Adaptability
Early on in the process of defining a product and the business around it, a product development team is small enough to retain a high degree of adaptability. The stakes are still low, the stakeholders are few and the decisions are easier and faster to make. This advantage can be leveraged with Agile development with continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD). Any new advancement gets released to market, gets used by customers and the incoming feedback leads to important and helpful change. In short, continuous iterations function as enablers for improvement.

Once the team has grown beyond 9-10 people, there needs to be a way to retain adaptability. The formerly vision-based management needs to become mission-based. That’s because the departmentalization required to develop highly-responsive teams cannot go on while everything depends on the founders’ vision. A mission statement can lead multiple teams much more effectively. The command structure may also need some revisiting.

4. Runway
A startup venture involves several different costs. These include — but are not limited to — the costs incurred to implement the various user stories, epics or components for the MVP; starting with the most prominent ones:

Technical architecture and related subscriptions
Payroll
Gear, office furnishing
Admin, legal and financial advice
Insurance, liabilities and patents
Depending on the types — and size — of funds available, they may or may not be sufficient to fund a startup up to the launch date. This is a critical consideration regarding the viability of the entire endeavor. Handling costs to try and optimally distribute funds and make sure the attempt comes to fruition is of paramount importance towards extending the runway, at least enough for the product to take off.

How your startup can benefit from an MVP
The most prominent benefit of an MVP is understanding whether customers really need or want the product. One can gather customers’ interest without fully developing the product. In essence, the sooner we can find out whether it’s appealing to customers, the less the risk of wasting effort and budget developing something that will fail in the market. That said, an MVP will bring focus to the product’s value proposition and promote efficiency; all without being the end-product.

1. Validation
The MVP should either have the ability to convince users that it solves the problem; or, it should include the actual features to solve it with. Early and quick iterations will field-test what is actually quite more than proof of concept — but not an entirely marketable product, in the real market it’s being developed for.

The Lean Canvas or the Business Model Canvas has 9 distinct components. Most of the time, for a startup at least, these are initially filled with assumptions and leaps of faith. Each of them needs to be thoroughly tested for validity. The MVP can be used to try and validate some or most of these assumptions; making for a more robust Business Model, at the same time.

2. Iterative process
Iterations, at any level, are enablers. They enable the product development team to gather feedback and understand their users insanely better than they would with a waterfall management style. But, they’re not “means to an end” in the strictest sense. Jumping from feature to feature leaving most of them in a flimsy state makes for an incomplete product experience. Customers will be unable to persist. Notwithstanding that, the product needs to actually work well.

3. Customer feedback
Feedback gathered as early as possible can provide the necessary signals towards product-market fit. That way, the product development team can take the right direction towards releasing useful features to address customers’ needs.

The team may run the risk of becoming too focused on taking every single point of feedback as granted, ignoring the actual signals from the market. This results in resolving singular customer problems instead of working towards product-market fit. Customer feedback should be used in batches, extracting market signals; not as single points of actionable data.

4. First to market potential
An MVP may allow the startup to establish solid footing as the first entry to market, ahead of competitors. It can be a good thing, allowing them the lion’s share of the market. 

But it can also be harmful; especially if the product is exceptionally innovative or disruptive and potential customers don’t understand its value yet. And, unless the correct solution is delivered to solve the problem, competition will win out as people become more educated on the type of product and its value; and as the market matures, of course.

5. Growth to scale
The market is quite forgiving to a small startup at its early stages. Any mistake can resemble only a little bump in the road. The less customers there are, the less apologies need to be made when something goes wrong. The facts are different when it comes time to grow.

For a growing business, it’s really easy to veer off course and really difficult to put the ship back on course. That’s to be expected, since product and people management increasingly becomes all that much more difficult. Let alone, customers have gone from visionnairies to early enthusiasts to mainstream, changing the field two times over. And there’s a catch; in dealing with mainstream customers, the product must be robust and reliable. And it will no longer be “Minimum”. For it to be “viable”, at this point, it needs to be absolutely marketable; all things considered, including competition. In the off chance that not all aspects of a great customer experience are considered, the chances of sustainable, long-term growth become increasingly thinner.

6. Manageable investment
There is something absolutely counterintuitive about a manageable investment. Less time and money given to learn and adapt to the needs of the market, actually reduces the risk of failure for startups. And, that’s the whole point of starting with an MVP.

While the first thought to come to mind is that a small investment will not be enough to deliver a product that solves customers’ problem well enough — if at all — statistics say otherwise, in a very interesting way.

Less funds bring focus to the entire endeavor. If people are mindful of their spend and try to find ways to make ends meet with what they have, they will organically end up simplifying their demands, set clear goals and accept the fact that they are actually here to learn. In contrast to that, more funds can ultimately be fatal. Having the money to create huge departments for marketing, sales and customer care before you know why one needs them and how they need them to be, is just a way to waste investment money; and will put them in a zombie state, or get them caught in the proverbial spiral of death.

There is an interesting notion, called MVIF. It means Minimum Viable Investment Framework. It should be able to clear things up why less funding is better than more.

Common misunderstandings
Teams may know the term MVP but fail to fully understand its meaning or purpose. The most common interpretation is, perhaps, a product with the least functionality possible. That is to say, teams usually ignore the fact that it should be sufficient to help learn all they need about the viability of their product and the business they’re hoping to build around it. To avoid such a predicament, we should consider the most common misconceptions about an MVP.

It’s not a PoC
A Minimum Viable Product is not a Proof of Concept. In fact, most teams come together to form a startup after they’ve developed their Proof of Concept. That’s to ensure the available tech can help them solve the problem they’re aiming for. But, making it viable takes a lot more than proving the tech can support it. One must understand their market, its segmentation, its attributes and nuances and identify possible obstacles, such as competition, customer education, financial viability, legal red tape, and more, before they can transition from a PoC into an MVP.

It’s not a Beta
A Minimum Viable Product is definitely not a Beta version of the product. 

While both concepts revolve around customer feedback, a Beta version is a relatively lightly tested product that gets out to Beta testers, so they can identify bugs, issues with User eXperience and general stability and reliability problems. Understandably, this is mainly a job for people with at least some tech savvy.

The “Viable” in Minimum Viable Product indicates that the product should function reliably and as robustly as possible to serve normal customers. These are people that may or may not be visionnairies enough to understand where the product is headed. Regardless of that, all recipients should be able to receive a version of the product that really works; and solves at least their most prominent problem. That’s so they understand its value and will be willing to buy it.

It’s not an MMP
That goes to say, it should not be one. A Minimum Marketable Product, sometimes comes long after the MVP. Despite that fact, oftentimes, teams over-engineer their product to outright accommodate the needs of mainstream customers. The development time — and budget — is considerably larger than what an MVP needs. This type of financially insensible approach, downright promotes waste; of both money and effort. In fact, by not releasing the product to market early and, consequently, not hearing from their audience, it’s the team’s loss. And it’s loss of direction, of focus and of clarity of purpose; not something to be taken lightly.

An MVP must be Viable
For a product to be viable — any product, really — it needs to be something that people want, need and can use to solve an existing problem. One that they would look for a solution for, on their own; one that costs them much more if it remains unsolved. Additionally, it needs to be easy to use, so they can understand it; get a great experience out of using it. Not to mention, it needs for it to be affordable. Making it good and making it easy is not enough. If the buying power of the target market is less than what the product costs, it will remain on the shelf.

Given all the aforementioned considerations are kept in mind, people will be interested in the product. Incoming feedback from demos, interviews, free — or paid — trials or  subscriptions will yield results in receiving strong signals from market segments; signals that will provide the team with valuable information as to the direction the product development should take. It’s the most effective way to develop a product that people really want to use.

What you need before you start working
There are a few prerequisites to getting started on an MVP; provided one is required. Sometimes, an existing trustworthy business may be able to present a new product with a simple pitch deck. In other cases, a product may be so complex that an MVP would be unable to provide sufficient solution to any problem. An animated demonstration or an interactive mockup with dummy data might do the trick before any development is underway. In any case, proper preparation is essential to its success.

1. Ideation
A team is not a team if they cannot march under the same banner. When discussions of Proof of Concept begin, the team brainstorm their ideas, document them and put them down on canvases (e.g. Lean Canvases) to see how they work in the bigger picture of their assumed business model. At this point in time, the team will discuss which assumptions may be the weakest or when every actional idea should be tested; when it would probably be the best timing for it to work. This is when the type of presentation for the MVP is selected, as well.

This step, however long it takes, is one of the most important steps in the process. It provides purpose and clarity to the team, ensuring that there is sufficient alignment towards the same goals. It also helps build healthy relationships among team members.

2. Staffing for development
Developing anything more complex than Proof of Concept can prove exceptionally difficult if not done the right way. And, developing an MVP does require skillfulness and experience. If it is indeed the way to go, the team should grow and welcome a few developers. At least one with knowledge on back-end technologies and one on front-end technologies will be required. 

3. Prototyping and architecture
Most tech startups need a product that can be scaled up to demand. That’s actually how they will scale their business up with even more traction, as well. The architecture of information is of paramount importance to the robustness, reliability and scalability of the product. This is to be kept in mind when transitioning from the proof of concept to a prototype, to the MVP. That is to say, product development should gradually include more and more considerations regarding the ability of the product to scale, without giving up quality. This is the stage where it all starts.

4. Building the MVP
The MVP is under way. And we’ve used all our knowledge and experience gained from talking to interested parties and initial users; and from the kind of visionaries we call early adopters of our product — also known as “earlyvangelists”. A lot of experimentation has already been done in validating various aspects of the business model, which are, at this point, based on assumptions:

Target market and customer segments (and possible early adopters)
Problems our customer segments have that are worth solving (and possible existing solutions)
The offering and its unique value proposition (and possible high level concept)
Leap of faith in suggested solution(s)
Distribution and communication channels
Revenue streams — even future prospects
Cost structure — all aspects of business
Key metrics for success (initially it’s about knowledge; later it’s about new or retained business)
“Unfair” competitive advantage (something that’s hard or nearly impossible to be copied)
That kind of experimentation is what has helped take a certain direction in product development, clearing up the path towards helping our first customer segment, which could — or should — be our high-speed segment.

Types of Minimum Viable Products
There are, indeed, several different approaches to an MVP. In other words there is more than one way to describe minimum and viable. As food for thought, we can take a look at the most popular ones.

1. Landing page
Oftentimes, either due to inherent difficulty in developing a product, albeit a minimum one, or due to lack of time to do so, a mere description of what the product is for and what its value is supposed to be, along with a list of its advantages and how it’s supposed to be different from other products in the market, would probably suffice.

All this information can reside on a landing page. One that will be allocated a modest amount of the budget to bring visibility to the product. The value proposition is the most powerful tool under a founder’s belt to help identify emotional responses — on the customers’ side — that work.

A landing page, not only serves to validate at least a couple of the assumptions mentioned above. Be it the customer segment, the problem worth solving or the value proposition and any number of communication channels, the team will be better off, knowing where to go next. That sort of knowledge, is power.

2. Animation or Video
An explanatory video or animated sequence can probably explain the product’s benefits, helping identify emotional responses from users. All one needs is a few versions of the message before the video starts and a call to action after the video has played back. Experimentation over this will bring clarity and provide direction.

A great example of this is “DropBox”, where it was really hard to develop an MVP that actually made sense. An animated sequence was used instead, where Drew Houston explained how the app was going to work. It became viral almost instantly, identifying a great number of potential users to be.

3. Email
Email campaigns, even though one of the oldest methods to disseminate information, are all but obsolete. To date, they still demonstrate conversion rates that greatly outweigh that of alternative methods.

On many occasions, founders may be able to merely dispatch a single email containing an offer. This will give them the opportunity to identify whether there’s a favorable response from recipients, or not. While this method requires using a list of contacts that represents the initial customer segment, it remains easier and faster than nearly any other method.

4. Piecemeal
A piecemeal approach can prove that an MVP can be a really minimal product and still be viable. The concept is to introduce a reduced featureset, a demo of the product. The development team can use off-the-shelf tools to build it. Implementing just a little bit of businesswise innovation, the product can launch to market and start collecting user responses, identifying their intent to buy; with any luck, also getting a signal as to their buying power.

The piecemeal approach demands that some of the steps in the process are done by hand. And that’s perfectly fine, since it may take a while for that momentum to be built, before the team needs the process entirely automated for self-service.

A great example of this method is “Groupon”. While they started out with a partially manually operated sales process, they quickly managed to fully automate their business processes, towards the business they’ve become today.

5. Concierge
A concierge approach is a great way to test an idea with a manually operated process, before going on to make it into a product. Let alone an automated one. The concept here is that every customer gets our best possible service, talking to actual representatives, discussing — and getting — what they need. The process gets reviewed and each iteration serves to prove a point and improve the business model to a point that it can support an automated system.

“Food on the Table” did this, visiting customers at their homes, taking notes of what groceries they needed for the week and then rushing to get the best deals and quality products to buy and then deliver to customers at their door. The concierge approach helped the product development team build an automated system that would help people do their shopping sensibly and efficiently.

6. Illusion or Wizard of Oz
This approach works best when the idea is to sell products other companies make. An e-commerce platform is the ideal example. That is to say, the company stocks absolutely zero quantities of the products they aim to sell. But they do develop a presentation page for each product. Once a product is ordered, the product development team will physically visit the appropriate store, buy the product and then dispatch it to the customer, manually handling all the logistics.

“Zappos”, a now reputable, well-respected and established company, started out their shoes and clothes retail business using this method; learning what people were looking for from their shopping experience, in the process.

Developing your MVP
It’s difficult to strike a balance in what is really an MVP and what is not. There is such a thing as “not enough”, as there is such a thing as “too much” when it comes to producing an MVP that serves its purpose. Finding out the optimal description for it takes time. And there are 4 steps one can take to keep everything on track.

1. Identify problem worth solving and pertinent market
This is all a matter of asking the right questions. For example:

What is the challenge? 
What is the problem not being solved; or not being solved really efficiently?
Who has the problem? 
Do they know they have this problem? 
Have they tried to solve it? 
Do they know how much money or time they’re losing because of it? 
Are there other solutions they’re already using? 
Do they like these solutions? If so, why? If not, again, why?
How much are they willing to pay for said solution or our solution?
Answering these questions will bring the team some clarity over what the market is, what the people in it need and how they perceive their problems and possible solutions.

2. Perform competitive analysis
Understanding the competition is of utmost importance in understanding what has worked in your targeted market and why. That’s how we can come up with what identifies as a strong element in any system, and what doesn’t. Consequently, this is an excellent opportunity to address the shortcomings of any existing solutions your customer segments may be already using. The point being, you can possibly avoid some or all of the pitfalls faced by older players in this industry.

3. Define the MVP feature-set
Defining the feature-set that will be available in the MVP boils down to understanding the user journey — or user flow. Putting labels on each step the user takes throughout the process will help identify which features would help in each step. And each step could be called — as we usually do in Agile Development — an ”epic”. Even though an epic can potentially encompass multiple teams and multiple projects, it’s not a bad way to start organizing all the work. If nothing else, it’s one way to go about it.

Once that is done, each feature could be represented by a “user story”;  a type of task that identifies what the user needs, when and why. This can be broken down into several tasks and sub-tasks to be assigned to different members of the development team. Each user story may need to include more than one feature; this is also OK.

All the epics and user stories will be then ready to be prioritized based on their importance and urgency and, of course, placed on a time schedule based on the logical order they should be built in; it really depends on what will bring the most business value first, what feature needs to already be developed to support future features and what step in the process we can or cannot do without.

4. Develop, test, release and repeat
The body of work has been scoped and sufficiently described. A Lean approach — Agile development, too — suggests that items set for immediate development, should be fully described; whereas items that will be built in the future should be described right before we need them, using the latest and most complete information available to us. This makes sense, since it’s a great way to avoid guesswork and common pitfalls.

The importance of testing
The MVP should be regularly tested as new things are added to its functionality. There is no better way to reduce technical debt and bring robustness to the product. To that end, there are three distinctive steps. Alpha testing, beta testing and feedback testing.

Alpha testing is done by employees of the organization, who are working on the product.
Beta testing is done by employees that are not working on the product or, perhaps, even a few really early users we can trust and have a good relationship with. Incubated or accelerated tech startups may also get some help from fellow employees in other tech startups from the incubator or accelerator.
Feedback testing is done by an external auditor; perhaps a specialized product testing company. At this point, the product does work. It’s relatively safe to say that another way to go about this is to release the product to market, in a controllable way; starting with a few verified early adopters, to help iron out any minor bugs and small details.
Feedback testing is really important; it serves as a reality check of sorts. It’s an excellent way to to verify that:

The product does, indeed, solve actual problems
It does it better, faster and more affordably than the competition does
People are willing to pay for it and recommend it to others (referrals)
Testing is an iterative process. It should be part of any important change in the product. And, every time, this new change in functionality needs to prove itself as one that helps customers get one step closer to their goals.

In a nutshell (summary)
The value of an MVP has been proven repeatedly in developing a robust, reliable and scalable product. In a high-speed market, it’s exceptionally helpful to understand how the market works, what it needs and how it can be described. Older methods of product management, such as the top-down — or waterfall — approach have proven to be inadequate in such cases.

The Lean Startup methodology, in conjunction with Agile Development are probably the most efficient tools to build an MVP the right way, while achieving high responsiveness and minimal waste, leveraging adaptability and high performance; all while still under development.

There are several different types of MVP; that is, depending on the type of product, type of market and the relevant attributes and characteristics that describe any or all pertinent customer segments. But, one of them is bound to work for any type of product.
Notwithstanding that, there’s no secret recipe to a successful MVP. The Lean Startup methodology, the Build-Measure-Learn model and the Agile manifesto are all tools at the product owner’s disposal, to use at their discretion towards mitigating — or even eliminating — the risk of failure involved in their endeavor; all the while maximizing the available runway, giving the team the opportunity — and resources — to be able to take off with their product. Just like they wanted.
