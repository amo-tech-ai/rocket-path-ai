Find Better Problems Worth Solving with the Customer Forces Canvas
Before you can build the “right” solution for your customers, you must understand the “right” problem. In my first book, Running Lean, I outlined a Problem Interview script for uncovering problems worth solving. In this post, I will present an updated script that improves upon the first.

Problem/Solution Fit
Inspired by the Scientific Method, the search for Problem/Solution fit starts with creating a model — specifically a business model using a Lean Canvas. On that Lean Canvas, you take your best guess at articulating a customer and problem hypothesis. You then get outside the building and attempt to validate/invalidate your assumptions using the meta-script below.


Problem Interview Script 1.0
The script starts by setting the stage and setting a problem context. Still, the heart of the interview is around exploring your customer’s worldview because that’s where you gather empirical evidence that either supports or refutes your case.

The only reliable way to gather this evidence is by exploring what customers did in the past or will do in the present. Asking them what they’ll do in the future, e.g., “Will you use…”, puts you in the land of biases and should be avoided.

If you gather evidence that supports your problem assumptions (validation), you can pat yourself on the back and move to the next step of defining and testing a solution with a Solution Interview:


Solution Interview Script
If you don’t uncover evidence supporting your assumptions (invalidation), you have to dig deeper for new problems worth solving. This is where people stumble.

Here are a couple of reasons why:

First, guessing at “real” problems at the outset is hard given our in-built bias for our solution (the Innovator’s Bias). Most of us unconsciously frame (or fake) problems around the solution we already want to build and then attempt to seek just enough evidence to convince ourselves we are on the right track.
Next, if you start with a non-problem, even though you can often see invalidation pretty quickly during the interview, recovering from it isn’t always easy. Limiting the problem context upfront limits your maneuverability, and it’s quite possible to leave the interview without any actionable problems to go after.
This is why I updated the Problem Interview script.

The Updated Problem Interview Script
Here’s what I changed:


Updates to Problem Interview Script
First, let’s talk about what I took out.

Problem Rankings are subjective at best
I found the Problem Ranking step never led to any useful insights, mainly because rankings are subjective and, more importantly, customers don’t often understand their problems well enough to rank them in the first place.

Next, I refined the framing around early adopters and problems.

Triggers versus demographics define your early adopters
When searching for early adopters, the key question is not asking “who” but “when.” In other words, behavioral triggers or psychographics are much more actionable than demographics.

In the photo sharing for parents case study in Running Lean, while I found moms to do more of the sharing than dads (demographics), becoming a first-time mom (psychographics) correlated much higher with a desire for sharing photos with others.

Outcomes and jobs versus problems afford more discovery
While setting a problem context upfront focuses the conversation, subsequent invalidation causes thrashing. Limiting the problem context is better suited for the Solution Interview when you have more evidence/confidence, and the framing is more around pitching than learning.

During the problem interview, where discovery is the goal, a better framing is around triggers and desired outcomes.

Triggers create a desire for better.
Taken together, the trigger and desired outcome create anchor points for the customer journey story you want to learn about.


Triggers and Desired Outcomes frame the customer journey
Something to note here is that while customers desire something better, they often don’t know how to measure and/or achieve better. But uncovering whatever their definition of better is will nonetheless be key to crafting your unique value proposition.

Example: When entrepreneurs get hit with an idea, they might define securing funding or building/launching their product as the desired outcome.

If you’re a longtime reader, you know that I consider an investor-first or build-first strategy backward. The objective during the Problem Interview isn’t convincing them otherwise (yet) —but getting their worldview.

Existing Alternatives and Current Solutions
Triggers and desired outcomes create the consideration set your customers to use to search for alternatives and select solutions. That is what you explore next.

When you frame the context in terms of outcomes and jobs-to-be-done, versus solutions, you should always be able to find existing alternatives.

The Solution Consideration Set
Inertia, Friction, and Next Summit
For each solution (starting with their most recent), you want to get the customer’s story on how they found, selected, used the solution and what’s the next goal for them :


Where Problems Live
Inertia represents obstacles and roadblocks that hold the customer back when choosing a new solution. These can be caused by existing habits or anxieties that surface when considering a new direction.

Friction occurs further down the road. Friction represents obstacles and roadblocks that get in the way during usage. These can also be caused by old habits that must be broken to effectively use the new solution and anxieties or frustrations created when adapting to the new solution.

The last step is assessing how well the job was done with their chosen alternative. Were they better off than when they started? And what’s next for them? This helps paint the bigger context for your customer and helps you visualize how they perceive their progress roadmap.

The answers to these questions are where you’ll find problems worth solving. I call this the backdoor approach to problem discovery because you don’t lead with problems but rather extract them from customer stories.

Here’s the updated Problem Interview script:


Problem Interview Script 2.0
The rest of the interview script is the same as the original. You wrap up the interview by asking your customers for permission to follow up and referrals to others you can interview. And finally, you document your results.

As you’ve probably noticed by now, the customer forces diagram (that I’ve also previously written about) not only helps you visualize the interview script but can also be used to document the results of your interview, giving you a tangible artifact that you can create after each interview.

That is why I rolled the visual into a new Customer Forces Canvas that you can download below and also use to document your results:


CLICK HERE to download the Customer Forces Canvas
While the best way to fill the Customer Forces Canvas is after an interview, some of these terms may still be foreign to you, like the difference between inertia and friction or habits and anxieties.

So I recommend filling one of these out on your own by putting your prototypical early adopter in the driver's seat.

Here’s an example of one filled out for an early-stage entrepreneur:

What changed?
Two new boxes and some title tweaks for clarity:

Added a box for the Old Solution
Helps identify what (if anything) customer switched away from.
Renamed Existing Alternatives to Consideration Set, and Current Solution to New Solution
Timeline is now much clearer to visualize. Top left boxes describe old state (solution that was fired). Top right boxes describe new state (solution that was hired).
Added a box for Actual Outcome
Makes it easier to contrast customer’s desired outcomes at outset to what actually happened.



The concept of an idea funnel isn’t new. It has its limitations. But I still find it a helpful visualization tool for outlining a high-level innovation process in search of good ideas. It’s also equally applicable to bootstrapping entrepreneurs and corporate innovators alike.

Here’s a reference idea funnel assembled over hundreds of bootcamps that we’ve run across bootstrappers, startups, and corporate innovation teams.

Reference idea funnel
The key to any funnel optimization is improving:

the top of the funnel (quality and quantity),
conversion rate between stages,
time to conversion between stages.
Let’s walk through the steps.

Strategy Alignment
I often get asked how does one go about creating something valuable from nothing. My answer: “It’s near impossible”.

This part of the funnel is about setting constraints. Without constraints, you find yourself chasing an infinite problem/solution space. In order to find a breakthrough idea, you need to start somewhere — or more specifically, many somewheres.

Vision and mission statements may be able to help with alignment, but they often err on the side of being too vague. At the core, everyone in the org should be able to

identify who is our customer (simple, but not always easy), and
what core job do we help them do (the bigger context)
The innovation thesis helps outline the organization’s worldview made up of beliefs and leaps of faith on how we intend to help our customer get the job done better. Portfolio management is a tool that ensures we aim to realize these beliefs from many different angles so as to leave no stone unturned.

Taken together, they help improve the quality of the top of the funnel.

Ideation
Where do good ideas come from? Answer: From anywhere.

I made a list of seven idea sources (if you have more, please post below):

Scratch your own itch
R&D/Invention
Analogs
Accidental discovery
Customer requests/behavior change/metrics
External changes
Innovation Theory
Each has its set of biases (that I outline here), and while we’d like to eliminate all bias, such is the reality. Rather than trying to create a better ideation process, I recommend lowering the barriers at the top of the funnel, and instead investing in better idea validation processes (further down the funnel).

Exploration
How do we know it’s a big enough idea? Answer: Start with what does big enough mean — minimum success criteria.

Innovation for innovation’s sake usually leads to interesting solutions, but disappointing business models.

Time-boxed business modeling (2 weeks )is a great way to uncover both the qualitative business model assumptions (e.g. using a Lean Canvas), and the quantitative business model assumptions (e.g. using a Traction Roadmap).

Taken together, they can be used to ballpark the viability of a business model at the outset of an idea. Setting some minimum success criteria is a constraint that helps teams align their ideas against business outcomes that matter to the org, which can then be translated to leading indicator metrics (like customer acquisition, activation, and retention).

This is a key step for establishing any kind of meaningful innovation metrics. Measuring the number of customer interviews, experiment velocity, business model canvas updates are all proxy metrics that can and will be gamed. Traction is the only metric that matters.

Also, within the exploration phase, any early customer/problem validation (through customer interviews, for instance) goes a long way in making a stronger case for the idea. You’ll inevitably end up refining your models for the better.

Selection
How do we decide in what to invest? Answer: Use the modeling/early validation artifacts and your current portfolio allocation to decide.

And, If the idea is promising, how much investment do we need to make for an idea? Answer: Every idea gets the same initial investment in time and people.

The first stage of the validation process isn’t about building a solution or even building an MVP (minimum viable product).
See: Don’t start with an MVP.

Rather, it should be about demonstrating traction for the idea by testing the core customer/problem (uvp), solution (demo), revenue (pricing) assumptions using an offer (not an MVP).

From hundreds of bootcamps, we have found that irrespective of the environment (startup vs corporate) and/or domain (digital vs physical), 90 days is sufficient time to navigate stage 1 — problem/solution fit.

Rule of thumb: give selected teams 3–5 people and 3 months to achieve problem/solution fit.

Validation
How do we measure progress? Answer: Review model evolution and innovation metrics at set intervals e.g. 90 days.

By standardizing all teams around the same traction metrics, you communicate clear expectations and have clear measures for progress. This fights the dichotomy of many progress stories which gifted teams spin across a myriad of different metrics — more specifically, the ones that happen to be trending upwards at the moment.

Having a consistent set of metrics allows teams to instead focus energies on navigating through the three stages: problem/solution fit, product/market fit, and scale.

Each has a clear mission measurable by the traction roadmap — leaving the teams to focus on achieving that mission through iterative learning and rapid experimentation — lean sprints.

Time-boxed reviews help with pivot, persevere, pause decisions and are used to inject more investment into teams.

The Idea Funnel Visualized
Over time, you get to see the funnel take shape:

A basic tenet of running lean is validating a product or feature ideally without having to build it first. This makes complete sense when you look at every product or feature as it’s own customer factory.

Customer Factory Blueprint
The first battle isn’t fought on the ground but in the mind of the customer.
It isn’t fought with your built out solution but instead with an offer.

This is true not just at the earliest stages of defining your minimum viable product but at every stage of the product development cycle.

And here’s the key insight:

If you can’t get people inside your customer factory,
it doesn’t matter what’s inside.

The way you get them inside is with an offer.

What is an Offer
An offer is essentially a stand-in for your solution that validates sufficient customer pull for that solution.


The offer is basically made up of 3 elements:

Your unique value propositionn which gets the customer’s attention
Your demo which shows them how you get them from point A (current reality) to point B (desired reality)
Your price or derivative currency of exchange which locks in commitment
Assembling a Compelling Offer
Before you can create a compelling offer, you have to gain a deep understanding of your customers and their problems.

You have to understand your customers better than they even understand themselves.

In my book, Running Lean, I detailed several customer interviewing (Problem Interviews) and observation techniques for doing this.

Since the book though, I’ve taken the work further in my workshops and bootcamps to make it more practicable — incorporating the customer factory work, customer journey maps, and the jobs-to-be-done framework.

Here’s an example of one of the deliverables from the early problem/solution fit stage:


It’s a marked up customer journey map that details your customer’s current reality workflow. We can then extract several layers of insights and inject our solution into this diagram that feed directly into making a more compelling offer.

I’m not going to walkthrough the detailed analysis steps today but I will walkthrough the resulting diagram that captures the job of your offer.

The job of the offer is acquiring customers i.e. turning unaware visitors into interested prospects.

The 3 elements I shared above are what go into assembling an offer but you additionally need to understand how customers buy in order to deliver your offer.

The Motivational Forces That Drive Customers to Buy
This diagram is best built up as a story.
So here we go…

Scene 1: The Push of the Trigger
Here you have a customer who is merrily going along his way until he has some kind of a triggering event.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

This triggering event pushes the customer to seek some desired better outcome or make some change towards progress.

The bottom of the hill is his current reality and the top is the desired future reality he wants to achieve.

This triggering event could be something explicit like having a new baby or it could be something more subtle like maybe having 2 of your friends purchase a new car in the last month.

These subtle triggering events can sometimes be hard to find, but if you look, they are almost always there.

A new baby is a significant life-changing event that pushes people to seek out all sorts of new desired outcomes or products. The more subtle car example trigger might not actively push a person to purchase a new car but it may all of sudden make him more receptive to car advertisements or promotions.

For this reason, some triggers are more *immediately* actionable than others, but knowing the trigger(s) can help uncover both active and passive leads.

Scene 2: The Pull of Your Offer
Understanding the key trigger and desired outcome establishes the situational context you need to best deliver your offer and the success criteria you need to communicate in your offer.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

If you get these right and place your offer in the right context, it pulls customers towards your solution versus other alternatives. This is where your carefully crafted UVP, demo, and pricing come into play.

If you have a big enough audience and/or brand, it is often possible to make your offer the triggering event.

Think of an Apple product launch.
A less extreme example is an educational webinar that upsells a product.

Scene 3: Overcoming Inertia and Friction
But only communicating the positive attributes of your product is not enough. You also have to address two negative forces that hold the customer back.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

The first one is friction caused by the anxiety or uncertainty of embracing something new.

Here, the customer visualizes taking this journey towards your solution which triggers them into contingency planning mode. These are usually mental roadblocks that keep people from taking a chance on a new solution: “What if I pick the wrong solution?”

Some typical remedies to overcome this friction are building in risk reversals into your offer. 30 day trials, no credit card required, money-back guarantees, social proof, are all examples of these.

The other negative force is caused by inertia which keeps people from trying something new.

You can think of this as the switching cost of moving from the current solution to your solution. These may be caused by actual switching costs like annual contracts or more cognitive switching costs ingrained in current behavior or habits.

A key insight here is realizing that even when delivering a potentially new disruptive solution, you don’t get to recreate the customer’s workflow from scratch.

When Steve Jobs introduced the iPad, he didn’t tell us 10 new things we could do with the iPad, but rather showed us 10 old things we could do with the iPad — only much better.

So the right approach here isn’t redrawing the workflow or ignoring this inertia, but making the transition to your product as seamless as possible.

Note: You can see the solution injection (blue box) in the customer journey map above with an appreciation for the customer’s existing workflow.

I will also add that not all friction and inertia is bad. I often use some friction and inertia as a qualifying criteria for identifying my best early adopters.

Your early adopters should have above average push and pull to overcome some of these negative forces.

But make sure you focus on the right force:

Here is the completed diagram with some additional annotation.

Customer Forces Diagram
This diagram is what I use in my work with entrepreneurs. After all the interviews, observations, and analysis, this is the macro level view that gets us talking about how best to craft and deliver a compelling offer.

Remember this is a journey that happens inside your customer’s mind which is why I show thought bubbles in the pictures above. The end result isn’t always a sale but commitment that gets your closer to turning that unaware visitor into a happy customer.


The LEAN Sprint

Experiments power breakthrough discovery in both the Scientific Method and our adaptation of it for entrepreneurship:

The Entrepreneurial Method
Herein lies the key to breakthrough in both:

If your guess disagrees with experiment, it is wrong. It doesn’t matter how beautiful your guess is, how smart you are, who made the guess, or what their name is… it is wrong.
- Richard Feynman

But while experiments are highly effective at testing guesses, simply running experiments is also not enough. The output of your experiments can only be as good as the quality of your input guesses. Further, running experiments may not automatically lead to new insights. Many experiments simply invalidate a bad idea and leave you stuck.

This begs the question: “Where do good guesses or ideas come from?”

The answer is that good ideas can come from anywhere. The challenge, of course, is that truly good ideas are rare and often indistinguishable from bad ideas at the outset. You need a robust process that on the one hand allows you to source a wide diversity of ideas, and on the other hand, quickly lets you vet good ideas from bad ideas.

This is exactly what the LEAN Sprint is designed to do.

What is the LEAN Sprint
A LEAN sprint is a time-boxed iteration cycle for sourcing, ranking, and testing new ideas.

We have successfully applied LEAN Sprints both internally in our team and across several dozen entrepreneurial teams at both startups and large organizations.

If you come from a software or design background, you have most likely been exposed to the scrum/agile methodology. While LEAN sprints are heavily influenced by agile and scrum (and more recently by Google Venture’s Design Sprints), there are some key differences.

1. The goals are different
The goal of a scrum sprint is demonstrating “build velocity”. The goal of a LEAN sprint is demonstrating, no NOT “learning velocity”, but “traction velocity”.

Much as it’s not enough simply to build a great product or feature, it’s not enough simply to demonstrate learning without business results.

Instead of pointing to the stacks of interview notes, point to the number of customers (or closest proxy of one) that you signed up this week versus last. Only when customer growth (or traction) can be correlated to learning is the learning actionable.

2. The participants are different
Scrum and agile are typically developer-only practices. LEAN sprints on the other hand require the complete team including your internal and external stakeholders.

3. Time-boxing does not dictate build or release cadence
I’m a big fan for embracing time constraints (or deadlines) for driving innovation and forcing action.

To achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan and not quite enough time.
― Leonard Bernstein

That said, I’m still an advocate for using just-in-time techniques like kanban and continuous deployment/delivery of value to customers. And the two are not mutually exclusive. Time-boxes in a LEAN sprint are only used to force a decision and don’t have to drive the release cycle.

The 5 Stages of a LEAN Sprint
There are five stages to running a LEAN Sprint. These stages are modeled after the align-diverge-converge technique, developed at IDEO, for fighting group think while enabling original thinking. In this technique, meetings are only used for alignment and decisions — not free-form discussion or group brainstorming.

5 Stages of a Lean Sprint
1. Expose Problems
The team aligns around a common understanding of your business model constraints or problems while staying disciplined not to bias their conversation with possible solutions. Much like scientists start with models, entrepreneurs need to similarly build models which they then rigorously test through experiments.

We use 3 models for this purpose:

i. Lean Canvas
Your Lean Canvas business model captures the story of your business. Using a journey metaphor, this story describes your rough ballpark destination or goal.

Lean Canvas - Ballpark Destination
ii. Traction Model
The traction model breaks this ballpark destination into a set of significant milestone markers that you then use to chart progress. While the overall goal is increasing traction, your strategy for getting to each milestone will be different.

Traction Model
Once you position yourself on this roadmap, your right next strategy emerges.

iii. Customer Factory
Finally, the customer factory model deconstructs the levers of traction and helps you identify the few constraints holding your business model back. These constraints represent the riskiest parts of your business model that require the highest prioritization.

Customer Factory
2. Define Solutions
The team then diverges to individually generate solutions. These are captured on a 1-page Strategy Proposal which I’ve previously written about.

Ideas into Strategy Proposal
Like the Lean Canvas, the Strategy Proposal is designed to fit on a single page to encourage deep thinking and rapid idea sharing.

3. Shortlist Solutions
These ideas or strategies are then shared, ranked, and shortlisted in another team meeting (sprint planning). During these discussions, we use a meritocratic voting method that places more emphasis on proposals that are based on empirical evidence versus sheer will (less grounded leaps of faith).

We are also less concerned about scoping effort at this stage. There is an art to breaking any grand strategy (like building a feature or trying a new growth hacking technique) into small, fast, additive experiments. The first step is embracing a time-constraint.

Instead of sizing our experiments into small, medium, or large buckets (like sprint stories), we instead force all experiments to fit within the same LEAN Sprint time-box. The right time-box for a LEAN sprint is determined by the stage of your product and the size of your team. I recommend starting with 2-week sprints and adjusting from there.

We don’t always get to completely validate an idea within a 2-week sprint window, but we often get to completely invalidate the idea in that time.

4. Test Solutions
The team diverges again to test their solutions (or strategies) using one or more experiments. My last post covered a set of ground rules for running good experiments. All experiment go through the three step build-measure-learn cycle.

Lean Sprint
It’s okay to run more than one experiment to test a strategy (either in parallel or serially) within the sprint window, but all experiments have to complete by the end of the sprint.

5. Decide on Solutions
Experiment results are then analyzed against the models from earlier and next actions decided in a sprint review meeting.

The cycle then repeats with the next sprint.

Putting it all together
Here’s what a typical 2-week LEAN Sprint cadence looks like:

The LEAN Sprint
LEAN Sprints aim to accomplish the following:

1. Goal — Break a big vision into a smaller time-boxed goals.
2. Orient — Align the team around problems versus solutions.
3. Leverage — Source/rank a wide diversity of possible solutions or strategies for achieving the goal.
4. Experiment — Test these strategies additively using experiments.
5. Analyze — Reevaluate learning against the goal.
6. Next Action — Decide what’s next.
