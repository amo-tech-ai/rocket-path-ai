👋 Hi there - I’m Ash. I share battle-tested recipes, strategies, and how-tos for systematically building repeatable and scalable business models delivered to your inbox every week.

Paid subscribers get access to the full archive, a private community, and additional coaching resources.

In the next series of posts, I’ll outline my recipe (Lean Canvas Diagnostic) for coaching an early-stage product team to focus on “right action, right time”.

Right action, right time: At any given time, there are a few key actions that stand to drive the biggest impact. Focus on those and ignore the rest.

Who’s it for?
Idea stage teams,
pre-launch teams, and
post-launch teams.
Prerequisites
The only prerequisite is a completed Lean Canvas, which we review together during the call. I do my best to keep this a low-friction step by explicitly instructing the team to

not spend more than 20 minutes on their Lean Canvas,
not do any other reading or prework to fill the canvas, and
skip any boxes they don’t understand.
Outcomes
Get a team to focus on the key action(s) that stand to drive the greatest impact on their business model within a 30-45 minute coaching session.


Steps
This is the 7-step meta-script I use for the Lean Canvas diagnostic:

I’ll cover Backstory in this post and the others in subsequent posts.

1. Backstory
I start each session by baselining the team and their business model by instructing them to spend the first five minutes walking me through their Lean Canvas.

I ask them not to simply read what’s on the canvas because I can read faster than they can talk. But, instead focus on things like:

the origin story of their idea,
progress-to-date, and
what’s keeping them up at night.
Unsurprisingly, they’ll also say many things not captured on their Lean Canvas, which is why I consider a “Lean Canvas in combination with a 5 min narrative overview” the best (and fastest) way to come up to speed on a project.

While they are talking, I ask several qualifying questions to build a few mental models in my head that I use in my diagnosis.

The first is the team’s chain of beliefs.

Mental Model #1: Chain of Beliefs
Everything we know is built on a chain of beliefs.

A business model story is built upon a set of key assumptions or foundational beliefs that stack on one another. These beliefs define how a team thinks (mindsets and worldviews) and prioritize risks. If these foundational beliefs are shaky, the entire business model comes crashing down. And so it’s critical to start here.


The best way to reveal a team’s chain of beliefs is by unpacking their origin story, progress-to-date, and what’s keeping them up at night.

Origin Story
These are the top three origin story types that I typically encounter:

Solution-centric: These ideas are seeded with a desire to use a new invention (or technology) to solve a problem.
Revenue-centric: These ideas are seeded with a desire to find a market opportunity worth pursuing, i.e., making money.
Unfair-advantage-centric: These ideas are seeded with a desire to commercialize an in-house invention or leverage some other unfair advantage (like channels) toward building a business model.
It’s important to emphasize that there is no good or bad origin story (or box on the Lean Canvas) for starting an idea.

Good ideas can come from anywhere:

1. Scratch your itch
2. R&D/Invention
3. Analogs
4. Accidental discovery
5. Customer requests
6. External changes
7. Growth Directive
8. Exploit an Unfair Advantage
9. Innovation Theory

Understanding the strength of their foundational beliefs is more important than where they started. I do this by asking teams to share how they know what they know, which I then mentally rank into one of three buckets:

Leap of faith (gut instinct)
Anecodal evidence (observation)
Empirical evidence (fact)
Progress-to-date
Next, I pay attention to what they have done to move their idea forward.

Did they take a build-first, investor-first, or customer-first approach to validate their idea?
Do they have traction? If yes, what kind of traction: interest, unpaid pilots, paid pilots, happy customers?
Where are they headed next? More specifically, what’s their 90-day goal?
What’s keeping them up at night?
The final piece of the puzzle is understanding their assessment of their riskiest assumptions or key obstacles holding them back from achieving their 90-day goal.

It’s important to emphasize that these first 5-10 minutes aren’t about coaching (yet) but active listening.

“Seek first to understand, then to be understood.”
- Stephen Covey

I am trying to understand how the team thinks, which will be vital in effecting a mindset change (if needed) later in the session.

The Lean Canvas Diagnostic: Part 2 of 7 - Structure
The 1-Page Test

This is part 2 in the 7-part series on the Lean Canvas Diagnostic. You can find part 1 here.


2. Structure
With the backstory of the idea out of the way, I then focus my attention on the overall business model structure. The goal is to strive for simplicity by constraining the Lean Canvas to a single page.

“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”
– Leonardo da Vinci.

If the Lean Canvas doesn’t fit on a single page (or slide), chances are high that the idea is still too complex in the entrepreneur's mind.

Encourage brevity
If the entrepreneur is overly verbose in their descriptions, using smaller fonts isn’t the answer, but fewer words.

Clarity comes from being concise.

Encourage the entrepreneur to use shorter sentences and pick their words carefully. The Lean Canvas isn’t intended to be a standalone document but a visual communication tool best complemented by a business model story narrative delivered by the entrepreneur.

The 1 Business Model per Canvas Rule
Brevity only gets you so far. The most common reason a canvas goes past a page is fitting too many business models into a single canvas.

In other words, they create an overly broad canvas.

Entrepreneurs often think that adding more ways to make money helps them grow their company faster. But the opposite is often true.

Making money one way is hard enough.

That said, being razor focused on one wrong way to make money is no better.


This is a classic Goldilocks problem.

We need a strategy that allows us to go broad and narrow at the same time simultaneously. We do this by splitting a “big idea canvas” into additional canvases.

Each canvas describes a single business model.

A business model describes how a company creates, delivers, and captures value from its users and customers.


It helps to think in terms of business model archetypes.

Mental Model #2: Business Model Archetypes
While we use many labels like B2B, B2C, and B2B2C to describe business models, when we group them by actors, there are only three basic business model archetypes:

A direct business model is a one-actor model where the user = customer. Example: A coffee shop
A multi-sided model is a multi-actor model with users and customers. Example: Facebook
A marketplace model is a variant of the multi-sided model with buyers and sellers. Example: Airbnb.
All models (complex B2B products, non-profits, healthcare, etc.) can be simplified to fit into one of these three archetypes.

Thinking in archetypes opens the door to applying well-known validation and go-to-market patterns and recipes to a new idea.

When I encounter an overly broad or a single narrow canvas, I advise the founder to create 1-2 additional business model variants using the arguments above.

To maintain momentum, I assign other variant exploration as homework, and we turn our attention to a single variant (often their strongest one) for the rest of the diagnostic session.

The next step is identifying what’s riskiest in their business model.

This is probably the most critical step and where most founders and advisers go astray.

Incorrect prioritization of risk is one of the top contributors to wasting needless time, money, and effort on sub-optimal experiments.

You can’t simply guess your way here but must employ a systematic approach — a topic for next time.

The Lean Canvas Diagnostic - Part 3 of 7: Identify Riskiest Assumptions

Prioritizing what’s riskiest versus easiest on the Lean Canvas is the next step in the diagnostic process.


This is the key step in getting a team to focus on “right action, right time” — the few key actions that help drive the biggest impact in their business model.

But while starting with what’s riskiest is a simple enough concept, too many advisers/coaches rush this step with costly ramifications.

Incorrect prioritization of risk is a recipe for wasting time, money, and effort on suboptimal actions. This depletes the already limited runway for finding product/market fit.
You can’t simply guess or “map and rank” a bunch of risks on a 2x2 matrix to surface the riskiest assumptions because:

Guessing at risk is highly subjective and prone to individual bias.
Voting on risks is prone to specialization bias — what’s risky to a developer differs from what’s risky to a marketer.
Even seasoned advisers often disagree on what’s riskiest.
Who do you listen to? The most vocal or most experienced aren’t guaranteed to be correct because startups are in the business of creating something new and a bit crazy.

Is there a better way?

The answer is yes... And it requires using a systems-based approach that doesn’t require any guessing — specifically applying the Theory of Constraints (TOC) to business models.

What is the Theory of Constraints?
TOC is a constraints-driven approach to system optimization, pioneered by Eliyahu Goldratt and described in his groundbreaking book: The Goal.

The basic premise of TOC is that at any given time, a system is always limited by a single constraint or weakest link. Imagine being tasked with improving the throughput of a factory. You could interview the line workers or managers for input, but doing that would most likely result in a list of problems and a list of possible solutions. Which do you follow?

Sound familiar?

A better approach would be to start by baselining the factory’s throughput as a series of steps. Your objective is to identify the slowest machine on the line. The slowest machine represents the current limiting constraint (or weakest link) in the system. There is always one, and this is where the riskiest assumptions live.


Identifying the riskiest assumption then is a 3 step process:

Baseline the factory throughput
Identify the constraint
Get to the root causes
Mental Model #3: The Customer Factory
A business model is a system too. The universal output of all business models is making happy customers. There are 5 steps to making a customer:


Identifying the riskiest assumption, then is a matter of

Baselining the customer factory with metrics,
Identifying the slowest step,
Mapping the slowest step to assumptions on the Lean Canvas.
Let’s walk through these steps

1. Baslineling the customer factory with metrics
There are two types of startups:

startups without traction and
startups with traction.
All the metrics in the customer factory above are zero for startups without traction.

For startups with traction, we need actual numbers for the five steps above in order to determine the constraint.

Running a business without metrics is like flying an airplane without instruments.

Neither is a good idea — especially when the early stage always comes enveloped in a fog of uncertainty.

If the team doesn’t have these numbers on hand, I assign that as homework while I continue the diagnostic qualitatively.

2. Identifying the slowest step
For startups without traction:

The current constraining step is acquisition.

In a real factory, you can’t make finished products without first acquiring the raw materials. This seems like common sense, but it is common to see the exact opposite in practice when it comes to the world of products.

Most teams don’t start with acquisition and defer building a customer pipeline until they have a product ready to use/sell.

This is backward.

For startups with traction:

We need metrics to determine the current constraining step. However, I still focus on asking questions about acquisition because while getting to paying customers is a good first step, establishing repeatability next will be a necessary precondition for scalability.

I aim to determine whether the team knows

who their customer is.
what problems do they have?
what attracted them to the solution?
How will they repeatably acquire their next X customers?
The business model isn't yet repeatable if the startup’s paying customers come in randomly or represent many distinct customer segments, channels, and/or price points.

3. Getting to the riskiest assumptions
The boxes that map to acquisition are the same ones that represent desirability, i.e., do customers want this product?


Contrary to popular belief, one doesn’t need a product to test for desirability - just a unique value proposition.

Does the unique value proposition communicate a difference that matters to customers?

That is the stress test I’ll cover next time.

The Lean Canvas Diagnostic - Part 4 of 7: Desirability Stress Testing

The top reason why new products fail is building something nobody wants. Why does this happen?

Because entrepreneurs are naturally predisposed to fall in love with their solutions, and they manage to convince themselves that if they build an “awesome” enough solution, people will come — the Field of Dreams.

They frame their differentiation in terms of the novelty of their solution, but if this difference doesn’t matter to customers, the product fails to grab attention.

This kind of solution-centric framing happens to most entrepreneurs and happens unconsciously, which is why I coined it The Innovator’s Bias.

When they have decided to build a hammer, everything starts looking like a nail.


The best way to help your teams sidestep this bias is to help them craft a Why Now Elevator Pitch that builds upon the Innovator’s Gift mental model.

Mental Model #4: The Innovator’s Gift
The basic premise of the Innovator’s Gift is that new problems worth solving come from old solutions. In other words, when building an innovative product, one needs an innovative solution but not an innovative problem.

The problem needs to be old and familiar.

The best way to demonstrate true differentiation comes from nailing a familiar problem with an existing alternative and promising something better (UVP).


The Why Now Elevator Pitch
The Why Now Elevator Pitch makes a case for why a product needs to exist without relying on the solution box. You do this by walking the canvas with the team in the order shown below:


1. Name an undeniable shift in the world that breaks the old way (Macro Switching Trigger)
Ask the team to name a big and relevant change (not caused by them) that breaks the old way and creates an opening for their new way.

Examples:

The global entrepreneurial renaissance.
Climate change
AI-as-a-service going mainstream
2. Identify what's it for (Job-to-be-done)
Think of the use case or the job their customers are trying to get done. In other words, in what context will their product get used? Don't settle for benefits. Instead, focus on desired outcomes.

Example:

When entrepreneurs (customers) get hit with a killer idea, they often need to raise money (job) to get their idea off the ground (desired outcome).
3. Identify who's it for (Early Adopters)
While it's tempting to rely on many demographical attributes to define early adopters, remember that psychographic (or behavioral) attributes are more actionable.

Use simple labels to describe the protagonist in the startup’s story (their customer) and rely on actions to identify them.

Example:

Early-stage entrepreneurs
4. Identify what they currently use (Existing Alternatives)
Many startup founders manage to convince themselves that they have no competition. But this is often because they aren’t looking broadly enough and defining their competition solely in terms of their solution or product category.

You need to help them transcend category.

If they are building cutting-edge collaboration software, for instance, their immediate competitor might not be the shiny startup down the street but email.

Email is free and ubiquitous and the de facto collaboration platform. Sure, they may think they have superior and better technology, but their challenge will be getting people to stop using email and start using their product instead.

Email and spreadsheets have killed more startups than other startups.

That is why you won’t find a “Competition” box on the Lean Canvas but the more general “Existing Alternatives” box.

Example:

For the job of fundraising, early-stage entrepreneurs hire

Business plans
Executive summaries
10-page slide-decks
5. Identify what’s broken with the old way (Problems)
Anchoring against problems with the old way is the secret to crafting an effective pitch that grabs attention and causes a switch — because it’s specific, familiar, and compelling.

Example:

What’s broken with the business plan?

Nobody reads business plans.
6. How will they cause a switch (UVP)
From here, crafting a compelling UVP is a matter of delivering a better outcome or eliminating a big-enough problem (or both). However, it's not enough to promise something incrementally better.

Incrementally better means the incumbent wins.

They win because they were there first and have an established customer relationship. In other words, it's easier for customers to trust an existing alternative, even with some problems, than a new, untested, risky solution.

Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.

To cause a switch, a unique value proposition needs to be significantly better. Think 3x-10x better.

Here's a simple example: Would you switch to a new computer operating system that promised you a 10% gain in productivity? The answer is no. The promised gain is only incrementally better and isn't worth the hassle.

How about switching to a wholly reimagined virtual reality (VR) based operating system that promises a 10x gain in productivity? See the difference?

Promising a 3x-10x gain isn't easy. The good news is that you don't have to deliver this promise just by being functionally better.

Is coffee from a specialty coffee shop three times better than a large coffee chain? Can the coffee drinker tell them apart in a blind taste test? You don’t have to deliver significantly better solely by being functionally better. Emotion helps.

“Functionally better” is where needs live. “Emotionally better” is where wants live.

Being functionally better aims to address unmet needs. Positioning a product this way can be enough to cause a switch if these unmet needs are well understood by customers as obstacles standing in the way of achieving their desired outcomes (what they want).

If customers do not understand unmet needs, it’s far more powerful to switch your positioning to address their wants or desired outcomes.

Example,

“We help you create a business plan faster” is positioning around being functionally better.
“We help you create a business plan that gets read” is positioning around being emotionally better.
7. Craft the elevator pitch
Once you’ve walked the canvas and tightened the boxes above, use the template below to help the team assemble a killer elevator pitch:

When [customers] encounter a [triggering event],
they need to do [job-to-be-done] in order to achieve [desired outcome].

They would normally use [existing alternatives],
but because of [switching trigger] these [existing alternatives] no longer work because of [these problems]. If these problems are left unaddressed, then [what’s at stake]. _

So we built a solution that helps [customers]
achieve [desired outcome] by helping them [unique value proposition].

Here's an example of an elevator pitch from one of my products:

When entrepreneurs get hit with a killer idea,
they often need to raise money in order to get their idea off the ground.

They would normally write a 40-page business plan,
but because of the recent explosion in the number of startups all over the world (global entrepreneurial renaissance), no one reads business plans anymore. We are living at a time where there are far too many ideas competing for attention. Investors today don’t fund or read business plans and instead look for startups with traction. If a startup fails to grab the attention of investors, they don’t get the necessary resources to grow their idea, and it withers away. _

So we built a solution that helps entrepreneurs
communicate their idea clearly and concisely in under 20 minutes and get buy-in from key stakeholders—so they can spend more time building versus planning their business.

The Lean Canvas Diagnostic - Part 5 of 7: Viability

Once the desirability story is formed, I focus on viability, i.e., is the idea worth pursuing?


There are two key inputs for stress-testing viability:

a goal, and
the pricing model.
I usually find that neither is well-defined at this point.

The key metrics box usually describes things that the startup will measure in the future (like trials and conversion rates) but is often absent a specific success metric goal,
The revenue stream box usually describes how the startup will make money (like subscriptions or advertising) but is often absent on specific pricing.
It is impossible to stress-test viability without specific numbers.

So, my objective during this first diagnostic session is to help the team define these inputs for their business model.Coming off the desirability stress test, pricing is usually a natural segue.Setting Fair Pricing

If the revenue stream box lacks specific pricing, I ask the team why they don’t have a price: The most common reason I hear is that the solution is not yet fully defined, so setting specific pricing is premature.
If the revenue stream box has specific pricing, I ask the team how they set that price: I usually hear some form of cost-based pricing where the team takes the cost to build/deliver their solution and slaps a margin. Or they try to undercut the competitors with lower pricing to make their solution more appealing.
Both of these use a solution-centric/cost-structure approach which is backward and sub-optimal.It’s backward because

customers don’t care about a product’s cost structure.
They care about achieving their desired outcomes (value) at a fair price.
They determine the fair price by comparing the product to existing alternatives.
In other words, fair pricing doesn’t come from the solution or cost-structure box but from the existing alternatives and unique value proposition box.


The optimal price sits somewhere between two anchors.

The first anchor comes from the monetary value customers place on the unique value proposition. A customer will only use a product if they stand to realize more value for themselves than they pay. This anchor typically sets the ceiling for pricing.
The second anchor comes from the cost of the existing alternatives. In other words, how much time, money, and effort are customers currently spending on getting the job done? If the UVP is indeed better, one can charge a premium, but be wary that customers will always compare the product against the alternatives. This anchor typically sets the floor for pricing.
I use this reasoning to help the team set/reset pricing for their product. Ballparking (rough estimation) is perfectly fine at this stage.I then turn to goal setting.Setting a Success Metric Goal

Teams are often asked to set goals, but because they are asked to estimate their ideas' 5-7 year maximum upside potential (unknowable at the outset), they either make up a fictional number or don’t bother setting any goals.Neither is a good outcome.I instead ask a different question: “What’s your minimum success criteria?”

The Minimum Success Criteria (MSC) is the smallest outcome that would deem an idea a success three years from now.

Why three years?

Easier to visualize than five years.
Sufficient time for most products to achieve product/market fit.
Things get much clearer (fog lifts) after product/market fit.

If the team struggles to formulate a precise number, I invite them to ballpark their goal against their ambition or plans for the idea by showing them the following image:


In the sport of entrepreneurship, there are only four types of games to play when we employ order-of-magnitude thinking.

In most cases, the minimum success criteria for an idea isn’t set by the team, but their environment.

I ask them to pick the level that most closely aligns with their ambition and tell them they’ll have ample opportunity to refine this number later for more precision.Picking a level is important at this stage because each level of the game requires different rules, tactics, and strategies to win. Picking a level sets the constraint against which we can test their idea for viability.Set the stage for the Rapid Viability Stress Test.

With these two inputs set, having seen thousands of models, I can usually tell near-instantly if the idea would be viable. But rather than share my opinion, I instead share a link to the Rapid Viability Stress Test recipe and instruct the team to administer this test on their own before our next coaching session.I do this for two reasons:

It allows me to complete reviewing the rest of the boxes with the team.
More importantly, it teaches the team how to gauge their ideas, an essential skill to learn independently.
With that, I move to the box that the team has been patiently waiting to get to: The Solution box.This is when we start discussing the feasibility of the idea.A topic for next time.The Lean Canvas Diagnostic 7-Part Series TOC

The Lean Canvas Diagnostic - Part 6 of 7: Feasibility

Feasibility to a team comes down to “Can we build the solution?”

To me, feasibility comes down to the 3Ts: Team, Traction, and Timeline.


While I got a general snapshot of traction during the backstory, it’s still a single data point — making it premature to discuss traction and timeline until the team completes the first pass of their Traction Roadmap. You’ll remember that this was assigned as homework in the viability section and is to be completed before our next session.

Here’s what a completed Traction Roadmap looks like:


A Traction Roadmap helps chart the key milestones of a product by stage and is key to helping the team focus on right action, right time.

So what do we discuss until then? In place of a completed traction roadmap, I rely on a rough assessment of risk using the 10x stage rollout chart below:


If the product has no traction (customers), desirability is typically the riskiest (not feasibility). Even as the product reaches more customers, you’ll see that initially, viability matters more than feasibility.

Because of the Innovator’s Bias (love for their solution), most teams flip this risk prioritization and emphasize their product over the customer or market.

My objective is to reflip this prioritization, not by lecturing but by running an experiment that triggers the team to change their perspective.

The Innovator’s Bias is immune to lecture.

The type of experiment you run will depend on the team’s coachability.

Tactical Experiment
If the team’s risk assessment and current actions align with the chart above (rare but possible), I will spend the remaining time designing an experiment and, more importantly, removing any tactical roadblocks.

For instance, if the team knows they should be talking to customers but are struggling to set up calls, that’s where I’d provide help.

Thought Experiment
If the team’s risk assessment doesn’t align with the chart above, but I read the team to be coachable, I’ll attempt to make a rational argument against their current course of action.

For instance, if they are building a big product, I might argue for reducing scope and going faster with a smaller product or using a non-traditional approach like concierge or wizard-of-oz for their first iteration. Having a few well-known concrete case studies (e.g. Tesla, Airbnb, Facebook) to back up the new strategy goes a long way to trigger a course correction.

Learning Experiment
More commonly, though, I encounter one of the four dangerous animal archetypes:


Credit: Productboard.com
HiPPO: Highest Paid Person’s Opinion

WOLF: Working On Latest Fire

RHINO: Really Here In Name Only

ZEBRA: Zero Evidence But Really Arrogant

And a different approach is called for - something I call Judo Strategy.

In the sport of Judo, when you confront a larger opponent with momentum, you don’t stand in their way but aim to get them off-balance.

More practically, when I encounter a team that is focused on wrong action wrong time, and they don’t seem to be coachable, I first align on something they want (versus need), then show them how to go faster, which often translates to fail faster.

For instance, if I encounter a team focused on fundraising but have no traction. Rather than lecturing, I’ll share my “killer” 10-page slide deck for pitching investors and offer a review.

As they work through the slides, it becomes apparent quickly that traction matters to investors above all else. And when they see that they can’t create this slide, getting some traction becomes a problem the team now wants to solve.

Wrap up
We’re in the final stretch here. In the next and final installment of this series, I’ll summarize concrete next steps for the team.
The Lean Canvas Diagnostic - Part 7 of 7: Right action, right time

Get commitment on next actions

This is where I summarize the learnings from the session, outline the next steps and get the team’s commitment.


Wrap-up Talking Points
One Business Model Variant Per Canvas
The first session's goal is to get the team to outline their idea as a business model.

If multiple business models exist on one canvas, I remind them to split them into 3-5 more specific variants.
I remind them to consider additional variants if they have just one narrow business model.
Why Now Elevator Pitch (Desirability stress-testing)

This is where most of the time got spent.For each new Lean Canvas variant, I remind them to use the Innovator’s Gift mental model to formulate a Why Now Story Pitch. This is where they need to make a case for their idea without relying on the solution.Traction Roadmap (Viability and Feasibility stress-testing prep)

I remind them to apply the Rapid Viability Stress Test recipe and create a Traction Roadmap for our next session.Queue up the next session

As insightful as this conversation may have been for the team, it’s essential to deliberately queue up the next session to build a continuous innovation habit loop.To do that, I first remind the team about the importance of getting their Traction Roadmap done:

For a new idea, this helps the team stress test the viability of their idea and formulate a launch plan.
For an idea already in motion, this helps the team double-check the viability of their idea and formulate a growth plan.
Then I pull up a calendar and schedule the next session (if not already scheduled).This simple step is an external accountability forcing function. I talked about the importance of implementing a time-boxed coaching cadence here.Once I have their commitment, we are done with the first session.The Lean Canvas Diagnostic 7-Part Series TOC



3 Mental Models for Continuous Innovation
Lean Canvas + Customer Factory + Customer Forces

Ash Maurya
ASH MAURYA
Coaching Lean
Before investing in any company, Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger use a latticework of mental models to evaluate the company. If it passes their tests, they move all in. Otherwise, they do nothing and wait.

Evaluating early-stage ideas is no different.

I have settled on 3 key product-agnostic mental models that I use to

baseline progress,
prioritize risks, and
formulate a “right action, right time” next step.
I’ll outline my key go-to mental models in this issue: Lean Canvas, Customer Factory, and Customer Forces.


Mental Model #1: Lean Canvas
This is the first mental model I use with a team, not necessarily because it’s the right one to start with but because it is the most popular — making it the easiest one.

A Lean Canvas helps deconstruct an idea into key assumptions that tell the high-level business model story.


Creating a Lean Canvas is an excellent exercise for founders to clarify their thinking and practice communicating their ideas as a business model.

In the process, you understand what they are trying to do and can apply a battery of stress tests to challenge assumptions and refine their model.

See the 7-part Lean Canvas diagnostic series.

Mental Model #2: Customer Factory
Most teams don’t have a clear and specific growth plan for their idea because they lack clear and specific metrics and goals. This is where the Customer Factory mental model comes in.


A Customer Factory helps model the key macro steps a customer takes from being an unaware visitor to a happy paying customer.

I use this model immediately after the Lean Canvas diagnostic to help teams size their ideas (test viability) and build a traction roadmap with specific metrics and goals.


Once you layer on the product’s current traction, you can help the team

identify the stage they are in e.g. problem/solution fit vs. product/market fit,
prioritize their go-to-market validation strategy,
communicate business model progress to stakeholders.
The model also doubles as a company-wide dashboard unlocking the real power of this model:


Once you visualize macro-metrics this way, you can use it to

benchmark actual conversion rates vs. the ones they modeled earlier,
identify key constraints (bottlenecks) in the business model,
align team focus on the weakest links (riskiest assumptions).
Mental Model #3: Customer Forces
What separates teams that achieve product/market fit from those that don’t are insights — seeing things others don’t.

The third and final model I use is Customer Forces.


Customer Forces is a customer behaviorial model that describes the causal forces that influence customer decisions.

While a Customer Factory describes what customers do, Customer Forces describes why.


Getting to why customers do what they do is the key to unlocking a business model.

Seeing a product through these three lenses helps test the desirability, viability, and feasibility of an idea:

Business Model Story (Lean Canvas) + Traction Roadmap and Metrics (Customer Factory) + Customer Journey Insights (Customer Forces)

These models aren’t just applicable at the outset of a project.

They can be applied throughout the product lifecycle from idea to product/market fit and scaling.

The Idea Funnel

Continuous Innovation Funnel

The concept of an idea funnel isn’t new. It has its limitations. But I still find it a helpful visualization tool for outlining a high-level innovation process in search of good ideas. It’s also equally applicable to bootstrapping entrepreneurs and corporate innovators alike.

Here’s a reference idea funnel assembled over hundreds of bootcamps that we’ve run across bootstrappers, startups, and corporate innovation teams.

The key to any funnel optimization is improving:

the top of the funnel (quality and quantity),
the conversion rate between stages,
time to conversion between stages.
Let’s walk through the steps.

Strategy Alignment
I often get asked how one goes about creating something valuable from nothing. My answer: “It’s near impossible.”

This part of the funnel is about setting constraints. Without constraints, you find yourself chasing an infinite problem/solution space. To find a breakthrough idea, you need to start somewhere — or more specifically, many somewheres.

Vision and mission statements may be able to help with alignment, but they often err on the side of being too vague. At the core, everyone in the org should be able to

identify who is our customer (simple, but not always easy) and
what core job we help them do (the bigger context)
The innovation thesis helps outline the organization’s worldview made up of beliefs and leaps of faith on how we intend to help our customers get the job done better. Portfolio management is a tool that ensures we aim to realize these beliefs from many different angles to leave no stone unturned.

Taken together, they help improve the quality of the top of the funnel.

Ideation
Where do good ideas come from? Answer: From anywhere.

I made a list of seven idea sources (if you have more, please post below):

Scratch your itch
R&D/Invention
Analogs
Accidental discovery
Customer requests/behavior change/metrics
External changes
Innovation Theory
Each has its set of biases (that I outline here), and while we’d like to eliminate all biases, such is the reality. Rather than trying to create a better ideation process, I recommend lowering the barriers at the top of the funnel and instead investing in better idea validation processes (further down the funnel).

Exploration
How do we know it’s a big enough idea? Answer: Start with what big enough means — minimum success criteria.

Innovation, for innovation’s sake, usually leads to interesting solutions but disappointing business models.

Time-boxed business modeling (2 weeks )is a great way to uncover both the qualitative business model assumptions (e.g., using a Lean Canvas) and the quantitative business model assumptions (e.g., using a Traction Roadmap).

Taken together, they can be used to ballpark the viability of a business model at the outset of an idea. Setting some minimum success criteria is a constraint that helps teams align their ideas against business outcomes that matter to the organization. This can then translate to leading indicator metrics (customer acquisition, activation, and retention).

This is a key step for establishing any meaningful innovation metrics. Measuring the number of customer interviews, experiment velocity, and business model canvas updates are all proxy metrics that can and will be gamed. Traction is the only metric that matters.

Also, within the exploration phase, any early customer/problem validation (through customer interviews, for instance) goes a long way in making a stronger case for the idea. You’ll inevitably end up refining your models for the better.

Selection
How do we decide what to invest? Answer: Use the modeling/early validation artifacts and your current portfolio allocation to decide.

And, If the idea is promising, how much investment do we need to make? Answer: Every idea gets the same initial investment in time and people.

The first stage of the validation process isn’t about building a solution or even building an MVP (minimum viable product). Rather, it should be about demonstrating traction for the idea by testing the core customer/problem (uvp), solution (demo), and revenue (pricing) assumptions using an offer (not an MVP).

From hundreds of bootcamps, we have found that irrespective of the environment (startup vs. corporate) and/or domain (digital vs. physical), 90 days is sufficient time to navigate stage 1 — problem/solution fit.

Rule of thumb: give selected teams 3–5 people and three months to achieve problem/solution fit.

Validation
How do we measure progress? Answer: Review model evolution and innovation metrics at intervals, e.g., 90 days.

By standardizing all teams around the same traction metrics, you communicate clear expectations and have clear measures for progress. This fights the dichotomy of many progress stories that gifted teams spin across various metrics — specifically, the ones that happen to be trending upward at the moment.

A consistent set of metrics allows teams to focus instead on navigating through the three stages: problem/solution fit, product/market fit, and scale.

Each has a clear mission measurable by the traction roadmap — leaving the teams to focus on achieving that mission through iterative learning and rapid experimentation — lean sprints.

Time-boxed reviews help with pivot, persevere, pause decisions and are used to inject more investment into teams.
