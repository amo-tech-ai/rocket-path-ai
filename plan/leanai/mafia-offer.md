Constraints, defined as an offer so compelling, valuable, and unique that customers feel it is irrational to refuse and competitors cannot easily replicate it. It focuses on solving a major, ignored customer pain point through significant operational improvements, often resulting in 70-80% conversion rates and premium pricing. 
Key Aspects of a Mafia Offer:
Irresistible Value: It moves beyond being just "better" or "cheaper" to offering a completely different, superior outcome.
Operational Backing: It is not just marketing, but requires actual operational changes (e.g., guaranteed delivery times, risk reversal) that competitors are unable or unwilling to match.
Targets Core Constraints: The offer directly addresses the biggest issue or limitation customers face in a specific industry.
Examples: Hyundai's 2009 program allowing car returns if the owner lost their job and AT&T's rollover minutes. 
How to Create a Mafia Offer:
Identify the Core Problem: Conduct customer interviews to understand the primary, unresolved issue in the market.
Make Operational Changes: Develop a solution that fixes this problem, which might require changing how products are made or services are delivered.
Build a "Unrefusable" Proposition: Create a compelling, bold promise that highlights the unique value and reduces risk for the buyer.
Validate: Test the offer to ensure it generates high interest and conversion. 
Developed from the work of Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt, this strategy transforms marketing from mere promotion to a fundamental business, sales, and operational advantage.
