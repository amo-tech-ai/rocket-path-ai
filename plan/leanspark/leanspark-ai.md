## A. Baseline Assessment — Steps & Descriptions

**Purpose:** Evaluate the startup across all 7 business-model dimensions.

1. **Executing Plan**
   Initializes the assessment workflow and evaluation logic.

2. **Assessing Mission**
   Checks founder purpose, authority, and clarity of why the company exists.

3. **Assessing Desirability**
   Evaluates customer demand, problem strength, and validation evidence.

4. **Assessing Feasibility**
   Reviews execution capability, resources, and technical path.

5. **Assessing Defensibility**
   Analyzes competitive advantage, moat, and differentiation.

6. **Assessing Viability**
   Evaluates revenue model, pricing logic, and economic sustainability.

7. **Assessing Clarity**
   Checks how coherent and focused the business model is.

8. **Assessing Timing**
   Evaluates market readiness and timing risk.

**Output:**

* % score per dimension
* Overall readiness score
* “Needs work” vs “strong” signals
* Recommendations + next steps

## B. 90-Day Campaign Setup — Steps & Descriptions

**Purpose:** Turn the assessment into an execution plan to reach first customers.

1. **Identify Primary Constraint**
   Determines the #1 bottleneck (in your case: acquisition).

2. **Select Validation Campaign**
   Chooses the right campaign type (e.g. Mafia Offer Campaign).

3. **Define 90-Day Goal**
   Sets a concrete outcome (e.g. 0 → 20 paying customers).

4. **Map Sprint Structure**
   Breaks 90 days into planning + 5 execution sprints + review.

---

## C. Sprint Execution (PDCA Loop) — Steps & Descriptions

Each sprint follows the same **PDCA** structure.

### PLAN (Automated)

1. **Set Discovery OKR**
   Defines what success looks like for the sprint (e.g. interviews completed).

2. **Define Prospect Criteria**
   Specifies who qualifies as a valid customer (90-day recency rule).

3. **Select Prospecting Recipe**
   Chooses outreach strategy (direct, referrals, network, etc.).

4. **Generate Interview Script**
   Creates a structured interview using the 7-phase Customer Forces model.

### DO (Manual)

5. **Conduct Interviews**
   Run 10–15 real customer conversations.

### CHECK (Analysis)

6. **Extract Customer Forces**
   Pulls pains, triggers, anxieties, and desired outcomes from interviews.

7. **Identify Job-Based Segments**
   Groups customers by the job they’re trying to get done.

### ACT (Decision)

8. **Verify Success Criteria**
   Decide whether to proceed, refine, or change direction.

## D. Sprint Outcomes — What Each Sprint Produces

1. **Sprint 0 – Planning**
   Campaign selected, goals set, sprints mapped.

2. **Sprint 1 – Broad Problem Discovery**
   Maps the opportunity space across many customer types.

3. **Sprint 2 – Narrow Problem Discovery**
   Validates which problems are worth solving.

4. **Sprint 3 – Product Design**
   Designs a solution that causes customers to switch.

5. **Sprint 4 – Mafia Offer Pitch**
   Tests an irresistible offer with real prospects.

6. **Sprint 5 – Offer Optimization**
   Improves conversion and closes first paying customers.

7. **Cycle Review**
   Make a **Persevere / Pivot / Pause** decision.

---

## E. Recommendations — Actionable Steps

1. **Shift language from features → validation strategy**
   Focus on proving value, not building AI too early.

2. **Use Wizard-of-Oz demos**
   Manually simulate the AI experience before automating.

3. **Resequence go-to-market channels**
   Start high-touch (network, direct outreach) → then scale.

4. **Break 90-day goal into weekly milestones**
   Track progress weekly instead of monthly.

5. **Document demo-sell-build explicitly**
   Define:

   * Minimal demo
   * How you’ll sell before building
   * What you must learn from first 10 customers

---

## F. What This System Is Doing (in one line)

**Assessment → Constraint → Campaign → Sprints → PDCA → Customers**

If you want, next I can:

* map this 1:1 into **StartupAI screens**
* convert this into a **wizard flow**
* or produce a **JSON schema for steps + states**

Just say which.
Got it — here’s a **much clearer, beginner-friendly explanation** of the whole system, **why each step exists**, and **how it all connects**. No jargon, no fluff.

---

# What This System Is (Plain English)

This is **not a dashboard** and **not just a chatbot**.

It’s a **guided decision system** that:

1. Understands your business
2. Finds your biggest risk
3. Designs the *right* plan
4. Walks you step-by-step to real customers

Think of it like **a GPS for early-stage startups**:

* You tell it where you are
* It tells you what’s blocking you
* It gives you the shortest safe path forward
* It checks progress every step

---

# Big Picture Flow (One Sentence)

**Assess → Find the bottleneck → Choose a campaign → Run sprints → Learn → Decide**

Everything else is just implementation.

---

## STEP 1: Baseline Assessment

**Question it answers:** *“How strong is my business right now?”*

Before doing *anything*, the system evaluates your startup across **7 dimensions**.

### Why this matters

Most founders jump straight to:

* building
* marketing
* fundraising

without knowing **what’s actually weak**.

This step prevents that.

### The 7 dimensions (simple meaning)

1. **Mission** – Do you clearly know *why* this exists?
2. **Clarity** – Is your business easy to explain?
3. **Desirability** – Do people actually want this?
4. **Feasibility** – Can you realistically build/deliver it?
5. **Viability** – Can this make money?
6. **Defensibility** – Why won’t others copy you?
7. **Timing** – Is now the right moment?

### Output

* Score per dimension
* Overall readiness %
* Clear “needs work” signals
* Concrete recommendations

👉 This is your **starting position**.

---

## STEP 2: Identify the Primary Constraint

**Question it answers:** *“What is the ONE thing stopping progress?”*

Instead of fixing everything, the system asks:

> If I fix only ONE thing in the next 90 days, what unlocks everything else?

Examples:

* No customers → **Acquisition**
* Customers but churn → **Retention**
* Interest but no revenue → **Monetization**
* Revenue but can’t scale → **Execution**

In your case:

* **0 customers**
* So the constraint = **Acquisition**

👉 This keeps focus brutally simple.

---

## STEP 3: Select the Right Validation Campaign

**Question it answers:** *“What’s the best strategy for THIS problem?”*

You don’t get random advice.

The system matches:

* your constraint
* your stage
* your goal

### Why “Mafia Offer Campaign” was chosen

Because:

* You need customers, not features
* You need learning, not scale
* You must sell *before* building

This campaign is designed to:

* discover real problems
* craft an irresistible offer
* close first customers fast

👉 Strategy is chosen **by logic**, not opinion.

---

## STEP 4: Define the 90-Day Goal

**Question it answers:** *“What does success look like?”*

Instead of vague goals:

* “validate idea”
* “get traction”

You get:

* **0 → 20 paying customers**
* clear timeline
* measurable outcome

Why 90 days?

* Short enough to stay focused
* Long enough to learn something real

👉 This turns ambition into a **testable bet**.

---

## STEP 5: Break 90 Days into Sprints

**Question it answers:** *“What do I do week by week?”*

90 days is too abstract.

So the system breaks it into:

* Planning
* 5 execution sprints
* Final review

Each sprint has:

* a purpose
* a learning goal
* a concrete output

No sprint is “just working”.

---

## STEP 6: Run Each Sprint Using PDCA

This is the **engine** of the whole system.

Every sprint follows the same loop:

### PLAN – Decide what you’re testing

Automated help:

1. Define success (OKR)
2. Decide who counts as a real prospect
3. Choose outreach method
4. Generate interview or pitch scripts

👉 You don’t start messy.

---

### DO – Execute in the real world

Manual work:

* Talk to people
* Pitch
* Sell
* Observe

👉 Reality beats opinions.

---

### CHECK – Analyze what happened

The system helps you:

* extract patterns
* identify customer forces
* group problems by “job to be done”

👉 Learning is structured, not vibes.

---

### ACT – Make a decision

You don’t “feel” your way forward.

You explicitly decide:

* Continue
* Adjust
* Change direction

👉 Progress is intentional.

---

## STEP 7: Sprint Outcomes (Why Each Sprint Exists)

### Sprint 0 – Planning

Sets the map. No execution yet.

### Sprint 1 – Broad Discovery

Finds *where* opportunity might exist.

### Sprint 2 – Narrow Discovery

Finds *which* problems matter.

### Sprint 3 – Product Design

Designs a solution people would switch to.

### Sprint 4 – Mafia Offer Pitch

Tests if people will actually say yes.

### Sprint 5 – Optimization

Turns “yes” into paying customers.

### Cycle Review

Final decision:

* Persevere
* Pivot
* Pause

👉 This prevents endless wandering.

---

## STEP 8: Recommendations & Next Steps

**Question it answers:** *“What should I do right now?”*

Examples:

* Don’t build AI yet → simulate it
* Start with high-touch outreach
* Sell manually before automating
* Track weekly milestones, not dreams

These are **actionable**, not motivational.

---

# Why This System Is Powerful

Most tools:

* give information
* give advice
* give templates

This system:

* **forces decisions**
* **forces learning**
* **forces focus**

It’s not about being “right”.
It’s about **finding out fast**.

---

## One-Line Summary

**This is a decision machine that turns uncertainty into progress — one constraint, one sprint, one learning at a time.**

If you want next, I can:

* map this directly to **StartupAI chat UX**
* design this as a **wizard flow**
* or translate this into **AI agent roles**

Just tell me.
Here’s a **clean, complete, easy-to-understand description of the LEANSpark system**, end-to-end — **what it is, how it works, and why it’s powerful**.

---

# LEANSpark — Complete System Explained

## Summary

**LEANSpark is an AI-powered business model validation system** that helps founders systematically turn an idea into a real, paying business using evidence—not guesses—through structured 90-day cycles.

---

## What LEANSpark Actually Does (Plain English)

LEANSpark replaces:

* gut feeling
* random advice
* endless building

with:

* **clear diagnosis**
* **focused experiments**
* **fast learning**
* **explicit decisions**

It doesn’t just *analyze* your startup — it **runs you through a repeatable validation process** until your business either works or clearly shouldn’t.

---

## Part 1: Business Model Design (BMD)

This is the **diagnostic engine**.

### Purpose

Answer one question first:

> *Is this business model fundamentally sound — and where is it weak?*

### How it works

LEANSpark analyzes your Lean Canvas and scores your business **0–10** across **7 critical dimensions**:

1. **Clarity**
   Is the problem, customer, and solution easy to understand?

2. **Desirability**
   Do real people actually want this badly enough?

3. **Viability**
   Can this realistically make money?

4. **Feasibility**
   Can you actually build and deliver it?

5. **Defensibility**
   Why won’t competitors easily copy it?

6. **Timing**
   Is now the right moment in the market?

7. **Mission**
   Is there founder conviction and purpose behind it?

### Output

* Individual scores per dimension
* Overall readiness score
* Clear “needs work” flags
* Actionable recommendations

👉 This tells you **what matters most right now**.

---

## Part 2: Constraint-Driven Focus

After assessment, LEANSpark identifies your **single biggest bottleneck**.

Examples:

* No customers → **Acquisition**
* Customers but no revenue → **Monetization**
* Revenue but churn → **Retention**
* Growth blocked → **Scalability**

Instead of fixing everything, the system enforces:

> **Fix the constraint first. Everything else is noise.**

---

## Part 3: 90-Day Validation Cycles

This is the **execution engine**.

### Why 90 days?

* Long enough to learn something real
* Short enough to avoid wasted years

Each cycle has:

* a clear goal (e.g. first 10 paying customers)
* one primary constraint
* one validation campaign
* measurable outcomes

You don’t “hope” — you **test**.

---

## Part 4: PDCA Loop (Core Operating System)

Every sprint follows the same loop:

### **P — Plan**

Identify the riskiest assumption and design an experiment.

* What must be true?
* Who must say yes?
* What evidence counts?

---

### **D — Do**

Run the experiment in the real world.

* Customer interviews
* Demos
* Pitches
* Sales conversations

No simulations. No theory.

---

### **C — Check**

Analyze results against success criteria.

* What patterns emerged?
* Did behavior match words?
* Did people commit time or money?

---

### **A — Act**

Make a decision.

* **Persevere** (double down)
* **Pivot** (change direction)
* **Pause** (stop wasting effort)

👉 This prevents zombie startups.

---

## Part 5: Sprint Structure (6 Sprints / 90 Days)

Each sprint lasts **~2 weeks** and has a clear purpose.

1. **Sprint 0 — Planning**
   Set goals, constraint, and campaign.

2. **Sprint 1 — Broad Discovery**
   Explore problems and customer segments.

3. **Sprint 2 — Narrow Discovery**
   Validate which problems are worth solving.

4. **Sprint 3 — Product Design**
   Design a solution people would switch to.

5. **Sprint 4 — Offer & Pitch**
   Test willingness to pay with a strong offer.

6. **Sprint 5 — Optimization**
   Improve pitch and close paying customers.

7. **Review**
   Decide next 90-day cycle.

---

## Part 6: Campaigns (Strategy Templates)

LEANSpark doesn’t give generic advice.
It selects **campaigns matched to your constraint**, such as:

* Mafia Offer Campaign (early customers)
* Demo-Sell-Build
* Wizard-of-Oz validation
* Channel validation
* Pricing validation

Each campaign comes with:

* playbooks
* experiments
* scripts
* success criteria

---

## Why LEANSpark Is Different

Most startup tools:

* show charts
* store notes
* give advice

LEANSpark:

* **forces focus**
* **forces decisions**
* **forces learning**

It treats startup building like:

> a series of testable hypotheses, not a vision board.

---

## One-Line Explanation

**LEANSpark is an AI operating system that repeatedly diagnoses your business, identifies the biggest risk, and walks you through structured experiments until your startup either proves itself or clearly shouldn’t continue.**

If you want, next I can:

* map this directly to **StartupAI**
* convert this into **agent architecture**
* or rewrite this as **homepage copy / product narrative**
