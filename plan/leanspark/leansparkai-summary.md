## Overview

**LeanSpark** is an AI co-founder platform that helps founders systematically validate business ideas in **90 days instead of 9 months**. Built on Ash Maurya's Lean Canvas methodology, it transforms startup validation from guesswork into a structured, evidence-driven process.

**Status:** Invite-only (Early Access Waitlist)

---

## Core Value Proposition

LeanSpark replaces:
- Gut feeling with **clear diagnosis**
- Random advice with **focused experiments**
- Endless building with **fast learning**
- Hope with **explicit decisions**

**One-Line Summary:** LeanSpark is an AI operating system that diagnoses your business, identifies the biggest risk, and walks you through structured experiments until your startup proves itself—or clearly shouldn't continue.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Business Model Design (BMD) - Diagnostic Engine

Evaluates startups across **7 critical dimensions** with 0-10 scoring:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Clarity** | Is the problem, customer, and solution easy to understand? |
| **Desirability** | Do real people actually want this badly enough? |
| **Viability** | Can this realistically make money? |
| **Feasibility** | Can you actually build and deliver it? |
| **Defensibility** | Why won't competitors easily copy it? |
| **Timing** | Is now the right moment in the market? |
| **Mission** | Is there founder conviction and purpose behind it? |

**Output:** Individual scores, overall readiness %, "needs work" flags, and actionable recommendations.

### 2. Methodology Expert

- Access to Continuous Innovation Playbooks and frameworks
- Canvas-aware guidance specific to your business model
- Workshop scenarios from 10+ years of teaching experience
- Quick framework recommendations for current challenges

### 3. Constraint-Driven Focus

Identifies your **single biggest bottleneck** using Theory of Constraints (TOC):

| Constraint | Trigger |
|------------|---------|
| **Acquisition** | No customers yet |
| **Monetization** | Customers but no revenue |
| **Retention** | Revenue but high churn |
| **Scalability** | Growth blocked |

**Principle:** Fix the constraint first. Everything else is noise.

### 4. 90-Day Validation Cycles

Structured execution engine with:
- Clear goal (e.g., first 20 paying customers)
- One primary constraint
- One validation campaign
- Measurable outcomes

### 5. PDCA Loop (Core Operating System)

Every sprint follows Plan-Do-Check-Act:

| Phase | Activities |
|-------|------------|
| **Plan** | Identify riskiest assumption, design experiment, define success criteria |
| **Do** | Customer interviews, demos, pitches, sales conversations |
| **Check** | Analyze patterns, validate behavior vs. words, measure commitment |
| **Act** | Persevere / Pivot / Pause decision |

### 6. Persistent Project Memory

Maintains context across sessions:
- Canvases
- Metrics
- Experiments
- Pivot history

---

## Sprint Structure (6 Sprints / 90 Days)

| Sprint | Duration | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Sprint 0** | Week 1-2 | Planning - Set goals, constraint, and campaign |
| **Sprint 1** | Week 3-4 | Broad Discovery - Explore problems and segments |
| **Sprint 2** | Week 5-6 | Narrow Discovery - Validate problems worth solving |
| **Sprint 3** | Week 7-8 | Product Design - Design switching solution |
| **Sprint 4** | Week 9-10 | Offer & Pitch - Test willingness to pay |
| **Sprint 5** | Week 11-12 | Optimization - Improve and close customers |
| **Review** | Week 13 | Decide next 90-day cycle |

---

## Campaign Types

LeanSpark selects campaigns matched to your constraint:

| Campaign | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| **Mafia Offer Campaign** | Early customer acquisition |
| **Demo-Sell-Build** | Validate before building |
| **Wizard-of-Oz** | Manual validation before automation |
| **Channel Validation** | Test distribution channels |
| **Pricing Validation** | Test willingness to pay |

Each campaign includes playbooks, experiments, scripts, and success criteria.

---

## Use Cases

### 1. First-Time Founders
- Systematic validation process instead of random experimentation
- Guided customer discovery interviews
- Clear decision frameworks

### 2. Pre-Revenue Startups
- Identify acquisition bottleneck
- Design Mafia Offer to close first customers
- 90-day sprint to paying customers

### 3. Pivoting Companies
- Stress-test new business model
- Validate pivot direction before committing
- Structured comparison of options

### 4. Solo Founders
- AI co-founder for strategic decisions
- Persistent context eliminates re-explaining
- Methodology expertise on-demand

### 5. Accelerator Teams
- Standardized validation framework
- Progress tracking across sprints
- Evidence-based milestone achievement

## Real-World Example

### LeanSpark Self-Validation

The LeanSpark team validated their own product using the platform:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Starting Point** | 0 customers, $0 revenue |
| **Outcome** | 307 customers, $115K revenue |
| **Method** | 90-day validation cycles |

This demonstrates the "eat your own cooking" principle—the product was built using its own methodology.

### Example Validation Flow (from screenshots)

**Scenario:** Founder with AI-powered startup OS concept

1. **Assessment Results:**
   - Clarity: 13/15
   - Desirability: 19/20
   - Feasibility: 15/15
   - Viability: 17/20
   - Mission: 13/15
   - Timing: 15/15
   - Defensibility: 6/10

2. **Constraint Identified:** Acquisition (0 customers)

3. **Campaign Selected:** Mafia Offer Campaign

4. **90-Day Goal:** 0 → 20 paying customers

5. **Sprint 1 Execution:**
   - Discovery OKR set
   - Prospect criteria defined (90-day recency rule)
   - Prospecting recipe selected
   - Interview script generated (7-phase Customer Forces)
   - 10-15 interviews conducted
   - Customer Forces extracted
   - Job-based segments identified

## Differentiation

| Traditional Tools | LeanSpark |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Show charts | Forces focus |
| Store notes | Forces decisions |
| Give advice | Forces learning |
| Generic suggestions | Canvas-aware guidance |
| No session memory | Persistent project context |

---

## Target Audience

- **Primary:** Early-stage founders seeking systematic validation
- **Secondary:** Accelerator programs, startup studios
- **Ideal Profile:** Pre-revenue or early-revenue startups with < 100 customers

---

## Key Problems Solved

1. **Unclear testing priorities** → Constraint-driven focus
2. **Generic AI suggestions** → Canvas-aware, business-specific guidance
3. **No persistent context** → Project memory across sessions
4. **Analysis paralysis** → Forced decisions via PDCA
5. **Endless building** → Demo-sell-build discipline

---

## Methodology Foundation

Built on established frameworks:
- **Lean Canvas** (Ash Maurya)
- **Theory of Constraints** (Goldratt)
- **PDCA / Deming Cycle**
- **Jobs-to-be-Done**
- **Customer Forces** (Switch interviews)

---

## Summary

LeanSpark transforms startup validation from a chaotic, opinion-driven process into a systematic, evidence-based discipline. By combining AI capability with proven lean methodology, it acts as an "AI GPS for early-stage startups"—diagnosing position, identifying blockers, and providing the shortest safe path to customers.

**Assessment → Constraint → Campaign → Sprints → PDCA → Customers**
