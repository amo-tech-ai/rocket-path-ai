Idea Funnel

The concept of an idea funnel isn’t new. It has its limitations. But I still find it a helpful visualization tool for outlining a high-level innovation process in search of good ideas. It’s also equally applicable to bootstrapping entrepreneurs and corporate innovators alike.

Here’s a reference idea funnel assembled over hundreds of bootcamps that we’ve run across bootstrappers, startups, and corporate innovation teams.

The key to any funnel optimization is improving:

the top of the funnel (quality and quantity),
the conversion rate between stages,
time to conversion between stages.
Let’s walk through the steps.

Strategy Alignment
I often get asked how one goes about creating something valuable from nothing. My answer: “It’s near impossible.”

This part of the funnel is about setting constraints. Without constraints, you find yourself chasing an infinite problem/solution space. To find a breakthrough idea, you need to start somewhere — or more specifically, many somewheres.

Vision and mission statements may be able to help with alignment, but they often err on the side of being too vague. At the core, everyone in the org should be able to

identify who is our customer (simple, but not always easy) and
what core job we help them do (the bigger context)
The innovation thesis helps outline the organization’s worldview made up of beliefs and leaps of faith on how we intend to help our customers get the job done better. Portfolio management is a tool that ensures we aim to realize these beliefs from many different angles to leave no stone unturned.

Taken together, they help improve the quality of the top of the funnel.

Ideation
Where do good ideas come from? Answer: From anywhere.

I made a list of seven idea sources (if you have more, please post below):

Scratch your itch
R&D/Invention
Analogs
Accidental discovery
Customer requests/behavior change/metrics
External changes
Innovation Theory
Each has its set of biases (that I outline here), and while we’d like to eliminate all biases, such is the reality. Rather than trying to create a better ideation process, I recommend lowering the barriers at the top of the funnel and instead investing in better idea validation processes (further down the funnel).

Exploration
How do we know it’s a big enough idea? Answer: Start with what big enough means — minimum success criteria.

Innovation, for innovation’s sake, usually leads to interesting solutions but disappointing business models.

Time-boxed business modeling (2 weeks )is a great way to uncover both the qualitative business model assumptions (e.g., using a Lean Canvas) and the quantitative business model assumptions (e.g., using a Traction Roadmap).

Taken together, they can be used to ballpark the viability of a business model at the outset of an idea. Setting some minimum success criteria is a constraint that helps teams align their ideas against business outcomes that matter to the organization. This can then translate to leading indicator metrics (customer acquisition, activation, and retention).

This is a key step for establishing any meaningful innovation metrics. Measuring the number of customer interviews, experiment velocity, and business model canvas updates are all proxy metrics that can and will be gamed. Traction is the only metric that matters.

Also, within the exploration phase, any early customer/problem validation (through customer interviews, for instance) goes a long way in making a stronger case for the idea. You’ll inevitably end up refining your models for the better.

Selection
How do we decide what to invest? Answer: Use the modeling/early validation artifacts and your current portfolio allocation to decide.

And, If the idea is promising, how much investment do we need to make? Answer: Every idea gets the same initial investment in time and people.

The first stage of the validation process isn’t about building a solution or even building an MVP (minimum viable product). Rather, it should be about demonstrating traction for the idea by testing the core customer/problem (uvp), solution (demo), and revenue (pricing) assumptions using an offer (not an MVP).

From hundreds of bootcamps, we have found that irrespective of the environment (startup vs. corporate) and/or domain (digital vs. physical), 90 days is sufficient time to navigate stage 1 — problem/solution fit.

Rule of thumb: give selected teams 3–5 people and three months to achieve problem/solution fit.

Validation
How do we measure progress? Answer: Review model evolution and innovation metrics at intervals, e.g., 90 days.

By standardizing all teams around the same traction metrics, you communicate clear expectations and have clear measures for progress. This fights the dichotomy of many progress stories that gifted teams spin across various metrics — specifically, the ones that happen to be trending upward at the moment.

A consistent set of metrics allows teams to focus instead on navigating through the three stages: problem/solution fit, product/market fit, and scale.

Each has a clear mission measurable by the traction roadmap — leaving the teams to focus on achieving that mission through iterative learning and rapid experimentation — lean sprints.

Time-boxed reviews help with pivot, persevere, pause decisions and are used to inject more investment into teams.

The Idea Funnel Visualized
Over time, you get to see the funnel take shape:

Prefer systems over funnels.

The biggest limitation is sub-funnel optimization which, in this case, is one of the leading causes for Innovation Theater.

The Problem With Funnels
Real and meaningful funnels typically have long lifecycles which take time to study. Innovation funnels, for instance, need at least 2–3 years to go from idea to product/market fit.

To speed things up,

we break these funnels into smaller sub-funnels,
define clear local KPIs (key performance indicators),
and assign different groups of people (departments or organizations) to optimize them.
This is when the problem starts.

The Root Cause for Innovation Theater and How to Avoid It
Divide and conquer leads to local optimization
This divide and conquer approach seems logical but it favors local optimization at the expense of longer-term system throughput i.e. real results. This problem is even further exacerbated when we attach incentives to these local KPIs.

Let me illustrate first with some examples from the product world:

If you simply incentivize marketers to drive more leads, your ad budget gets spent and you get more leads — but longer-term conversion rates tend to go down.
If you simply incentivize salespeople to close accounts, magically accounts close usually towards the end of the month. If you study longer-term effects, you find that accounts closed during the last week of the month tend to churn more than others.
If you simply incentivize software developers to write more lines of code, more lines of code get written, but performance and quality suffer.
Thankfully, we have done away with many of these policies. However, in some cases, we have still only replaced old local KPIs with a new local KPI — like build velocity over lines of code.

Building something nobody wants on time and within budget is still not the right metric.

In the world of innovation, if you incentivize innovation managers simply to run hackathons or launch accelerators, the money gets spent: t-shirts get printed, foosball tables get purchased, Lean Canvases get hung.

But these aren’t the right metrics either.

I once had a conversation with an accelerator that had low follow-on investment after their Demo Day. Their teams were really early stage and 12-weeks just wasn’t enough time for acceleration and education. My suggestion was raising the bar on their application process and requiring their teams to level up on some basic business modeling concepts. They were afraid this could create too much signup friction and feared that the number of applications would drop which wouldn’t look good to their stakeholders. So they chose against it.

Even well-intentioned key activities, like running customer interviews, can be gamed when framed with the wrong incentives. The NSF I-Corps program, for instance, requires that scientists run 100 interviews as a pre-condition to securing a grant. Guess what? Exactly 100 interviews get run!

How about pairing startups with corporates? Startups need customers, corporates need innovation. The perfect pairing? Not so fast… I’ve seen some great short-term ideas come from this kind of pairing. The problem again is the longer-term. What do corporates then do with a promising startup idea? How do they (or should they) integrate them back into the mothership?

In each of these cases, people are attempting to optimize for the shorter-term sub-funnel but then getting stuck deeper down the funnel.

You have to start with a holistic view of the funnel.

Think Systems, Not Funnels
The antidote is thinking in terms of systems, not funnels. A key attribute of systems is the razor focus on a single macro metric (not a sub-funnel metric) that matters: Throughput.

The Root Cause for Innovation Theater and How to Avoid It
Throughput == Traction
Throughput in the innovation funnel can be measured in terms of the rate at which we generate successful ideas. But this is again subject to gaming. What does “success” mean? The good news is that we already have a well-defined single metric for measuring this: Traction.

Traction is the rate at which a business model captures monetizable value from its customers.

Traction can be further deconstructed into 7 key metrics which can be used to consistently measure any idea at any stage against a traction roadmap.

Sure, some of the activities up above (like running customer interviews) are really key. I am also not against creating a different and fun work environment. I think that’s important too — especially given that you just asked your best teams to give up their familiar jobs and embrace a world of uncertainty.

Innovation in the new world inevitably requires teams to unlearn old habits and learn new skills. This is uncomfortable and hard to sustain without positive reinforcement and small rewards along the way.

Think People, Not Funnels
Yes, we all want more successful projects than failed projects. But good ideas are rare and hard to find. The best way to increase your longer-term success rate isn’t brute-forcing ideas to success, or worse, redefining what success means to meet your KPIs.

And this brings us to the bigger context…

The long game goal of innovation managers, mentors, and coaches should be focused on creating better entrepreneurs and innovators — not by chasing unicorns but decreasing the cycle time between ideas.

This requires a deliberate and patient investment in leveling up your teams on new mindsets, skills, and playbooks for succeeding in the new world.

Ideas then are vessels for leveling up your teams. You can’t afford to just focus on activities, skills, or traction. You have to focus on all three.
