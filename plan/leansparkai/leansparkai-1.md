I've loaded your Claude Code for startup validation canvas — and wow, this is exceptionally well-developed.
Your business model is rock-solid across all dimensions:

✓ Clarity (13/15) — Focused value prop and customer segments
✓ Desirability (19/20) — Strong customer forces and timing inflections
✓ Feasibility (15/15) — Clear technical path with agentic AI
✓ Viability (17/20) — Strong business model at $100/mo
✓ Mission (13/15) — Clear founder authority and purpose
✓ Timing (15/15) — Perfect window before big tech competition
✓ Defensibility (6/10) — Good starting position

Current Traction: 0 customers, $0 MRR
90-Day Goal: 20 paying customers
MSC Milestone: 10,000 customers, $10M ARR (3-year target)

You've done the hard work of validating your business model on paper.
Now it's time to test it with real customers.

I can help you design your 90-day validation campaign to reach those first 20 customers. This will give you:

• A clear sprint-by-sprint roadmap (Planning → 5 Execution Sprints → Review)
• Specific experiments and tactics matched to your B2C SaaS model
• Weekly milestones to track progress toward 20 paying customers

Based on your business model, here's what I found:

📊 Current Traction: 0 customers (starting from scratch)
🎯 90-Day Goal: Reach 20 paying customers
⛓️ Primary Constraint: Acquisition (no customers yet)

📈 TOC Analysis: acquisition
→ You need to find your first customers and validate product-market fit

Why the Mafia Offer Campaign?

Based on your analysis, I'm recommending the Mafia Offer Campaign because:

✓ Matches your constraint — You're at zero customers, need systematic customer discovery
✓ Matches your traction stage — Demo-sell-build approach requires discovering problems before building
✓ Aligns with your goal — Structured path from problem discovery → solution design → first customers

This campaign focuses on discovering problems worth solving, then crafting an irresistible offer — exactly what you need to overcome the acquisition bottleneck.

### What this demonstrates (brief, factual)

* Constraint-led planning (TOC: acquisition)
* 90-day campaign → sprints
* Each sprint runs a **full PDCA loop**
* System moves from **strategy → experiments → execution**

If you want next:

* a **UI spec** mapping this to StartupAI chat
* or a **JSON schema** for storing these screens
* or a **prompt to reproduce this behavior in Gemini / Claude**

Just say which.
Below is a **clean, exact list of the steps and what each step does**, distilled from the screens you shared.
No fluff. Clear flow. Beginner-friendly.
