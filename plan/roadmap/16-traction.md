Traction is the One Metric to Rule Them All


What is the one thing that investors and entrepreneurs want?
The answer is traction.​​

Walk into any investor’s office with the beginnings of a hockey-stick curve and you’ll create a Pavlovian response where they’ll sit you down and try to understand your business model.


​Notice I don’t even label the y-axis in the picture above. That’s how powerful the signaling effect of the sharp inflection point in the hockey stick curve is…

When things quickly start trending up and to the right — it indicates that good things are happening — that people other than yourself, your team, and possibly your mom care about your idea. The problem is that traction means different things to different people. And it too can be gamed.

Quick: Which of the 2 charts below communicates progress?

Which is better?
You probably instinctually picked the the chart on the left. But look a bit closer. Both these charts were plotted using the same data set!

The chart on the left plots the cumulative number of sign-ups over time which can flatline but never go down. This is your classic vanity metric. The chart on the right normalizes the data and plots sign-ups by month which is a more accurate progress indicator — but maybe not the better story you want to tell.

This type of charting trick used to work, but it doesn’t anymore. A more sophisticated investor will see right through such a facade. This means you have to level up your game and get smarter about traction.

What Is Traction?
Traction is the rate at which a business model captures monetizable value from its users.

The right traction metric needs to signal business model growth. In other words, traction is the output of a working business model.

“A business model describes how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value.”
— SAUL KAPLAN, THE BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION FACTORY

While you need to create value for customers before you can capture value from them (aka get paid), capturing value is what makes the business model work which is why I emphasized it in the traction definition.

That said, I want to emphasize that monetizable value is not the same thing as revenue. Revenue is an after-effect of value creation and not all that actionable by itself. In order to grow your business model, you need to uncover the key activities your users do that serve as leading indicators for future revenue. That is the concept of monetizable value.

This is a subtle, but critical, distinction to internalize. I’ll illustrate with a case-study.


Starbucks: The Third Place
Inspired around a vision of bringing the Italian coffeehouse tradition to the United States, Howard Schultz turned a single coffee shop that started in Seattle into a fast growing company. Like any other coffee shop, they were in the business of selling coffee. You could measure traction in terms of number of coffee cups sold, but like revenue, that’s an after-effect and not all that actionable by itself. It doesn’t tell you how to make people buy more coffee. Their billion dollar insight came by studying what key activities caused people to come to Starbucks and buy their coffee.

They started noticing that a number of people came to Starbucks, ordered a coffee, and instead of leaving, pulled out a laptop and started working. Pretty soon they were joined by others for a meeting. This repeated throughout the day with multiple groups. This was at a time when Starbucks was not all that comfortable a place to work — there was no artwork on the walls, the chairs were not comfortable, you had to pay for wifi, and the bathrooms required a key.

While this behavior (of not leaving after an order) may have annoyed some store managers, using sales data the company quickly realized that the lifetime value of these customers was a lot higher than their typical customer who simply bought coffee and left. In other words, time spent in store correlated with money spent.

To test if this correlation was causal, Starbucks probably studied a few test stores more closely, before mobilizing a massive rebranding campaign with the tagline around creating “A third place between your home and office”. Rather than turning the growing freelance population away, they invited them in — essentially launching the first co-working space before it was even a term. Over time they upgraded their stores to provide more comfortable sofas, artwork on the walls, free wifi, and yes they also unlocked the bathrooms.

This insight led them from a fast growing coffee shop into a multi-billion company. Today Starbucks doesn’t sell just coffee. They have breakfast, lunch, and dinner items including beer and wine in some select stores — doubling down on their key insight of not just selling coffee but creating a third place.

Business Model Archetypes
Starbucks is an example of direct business with one actor: the user who becomes a customer. In this type of a model, your traction metric is determined by the rate at which you create customers and your leading indicator is tied to the key activity that drives this.

Direct


Traction in a direct business model
There are 2 other business model archetypes: multi-sided and marketplace.

Multi-sided
Facebook is a classic multi-sided model with users and customers. Here too, you don’t need dozens of data points to communicate traction. Facebook uses just 2 metrics: daily active users and average revenue per user.

In these types of models, users represent a derivative asset that are monetized by your customers. In the case of Facebook, the derivative asset is user data triggered by repeat visits. This asset if monetized through advertising measured using metrics like CPM, CPC, and CPA.


Traction in a multi-sided model
Marketplace
Marketplaces are a special case of multi-sided models where you also have 2 actors but instead of users and customers, you have buyers and sellers. Airbnb is a classic marketplace model. This model is the most complex of the three because you need to manage both sides simultaneously. Value is only created for buyers and sellers when they conduct a transaction and you can’t rely on a proxy metric like number of listings. A marketplace with lots of inventory but no transactions is not healthy.

Airbnb uses a single metric to communicate their business model growth which directly ties to the traction metric: number of nights booked. If this number is going up and to the right, the business model is working.

What about other models?
You can extrapolate any type of business model using these three basic archetypes. As an exercise, I’ll leave you to think how you might categorize an enterprise software model and a non-profit. You can leave your answer in the comments below.



Traction is the Goal. Everything Else is Distraction.

How to focus on what matters at every stage of your product roadmap.
What is the one thing that both investors and entrepreneurs care about? It’s growth or traction.

The problem is that traction means different things to different people. And, it’s not enough to pick any metric for the y-axis of your hockey stick curve that conveniently happens to be going up and to the right and pass it off as traction.

Instead, you have to pick a single metric that serves as a reliable indicator of business model growth.

This begs the question: How do you measure traction?

In today’s issue, I’ll share how to reliably define and measure traction for your business and show you how to use it to drive focus on what matters at every stage of your product.

What is traction?
While it is tempting to measure traction in terms of revenue or, better yet, profit, the problem with both of these metrics is that they are trailing indicators. They tell us that the business model did indeed work in the past, but they don’t necessarily tell us why or how to grow the business model in the future.

A better definition of traction focuses on leading indicators that can predict future business model growth.

Future business model growth comes from past customer actions.

We can model these past customer actions as macro steps in a Customer Factory:


Traction, then, is the output (or throughput) of your Customer Factory. Unlike relying on revenue, this approach converts revenue into something more actionable — customers and their actions that lead to traction.

For example, traction in a coffee shop is better measured by the weekly coffee cups sold. Even better is turning that metric into the number of customers that bought those cups of coffee (probably not one-to-one) and understanding leading metrics like traffic per week, repeat visits per week, and referrals per week, which will do a lot more to understanding how to grow this business than just watching weekly revenue metrics.

If you have a multi-actor model like Facebook with users and customers or Airbnb with buyers and sellers, you’ll need to build two customer factories — one for each side that plugs together.

The universal job of any business is to build a repeatable and scalable customer factory.
The Customer Factory isn’t just a cute metaphor. The reference to a factory is intentional because it opens the door to systems thinking.

The slowest machine on a factory floor always constrains throughput. Identify and improve that step, and you improve throughput (theory of constraints).

Business models are no different.

This is the key insight for focusing on what matters and ignoring the rest.

In the following sections, I’ll highlight how to use the Customer Factory metaphor to define your go-to-market strategy by product stage.


1. Business Model Fit
Before building out a real-world factory, it would be smart to run some quick numbers to test feasibility and viability. If the factory doesn’t have a chance of turning a profit, why would you build it?

You can do the same with any idea.

Starting with a minimum success criteria goal and target pricing and customer assumptions, you can test the feasibility and viability of your Customer Factory.


Mindset: Simple models help us understand the complex.

For how to do this, check out the Business Model Design masterclass bundled with a newsletter subscription.

2. Problem/Solution Fit (Demand Validation)
Next, we need to get the factory running. But before buying expensive equipment, wouldn’t it be prudent first to study, then test demand — and even better to get some orders in?

That’s the deliverable from the Problem/Solution Fit stage - Validate demand through repeatable sales.


More specifically, you acquire “qualified” early adopters (raw materials or leads) into your customer factory. A qualified early adopter is someone who has taken a tangible action, like expressing strong interest or preordering, toward becoming a happy customer.

Contrary to conventional belief, you almost never need a working product to acquire users (and customers).

Mindset: Sell before you build.

Another point to emphasize here is repeatability, a fundamental system property. Simply acquiring X customers to declare problem/solution fit isn't enough. You need to build a system that can repeatedly acquire X customers/week to keep your customer factory running.

Mindset: The Customer Factory never sleeps.

3. Solution/Customer Fit (Value Delivery)
After validating sufficient demand, as defined by your traction model in step 1, you turn your attention to converting your newly acquired users into happy customers by moving them through the steps: activation, retention, realizing (keeping) revenue, and asking for referrals, in that order.


As before, it’s important to emphasize that the factory doesn’t go to sleep at this stage. In other words, your Customer Factory needs to acquire new users continually. But you shouldn’t move everyone through the factory at the same pace.

It’s important to recognize that since you’re building this particular factory for the first time, it will need fine-tuning. Instead of trying to scale throughput too quickly and having quality suffer, a better approach would be to start with smaller batches and progressively level up.

Mindset: Rollout in batches.

This lets you manage your risks more systematically and focus on your next key deliverable: Repeatedly delivering value or making happy customers.

The two key metrics that define this stage are activation and retention.


4. Product/Market Fit (Achieve Escape Velocity)
As your batches become more repeatable, your focus shifts towards optimizing for growth. This often starts with product optimization (new features), price optimization, and channel optimization.

The goal is to find a scalable channel or a self-powered growth rocket.

Mindset: Repeatability before scalability.

There are generally three types of value (assets) you capture from existing customers:

money (revenue)
content and data (byproducts of retention and engagement)
referrals
A self-powered growth loop reinvests these assets toward new customer acquisition. Let’s walk through three kinds of growth loops.

1. The Revenue Growth Loop
This growth loop reinvests revenue generated from existing customers to drive new customer acquisition. Money or capital is the propellent here, used to buy ads or hire people to run these campaigns.


Some commonly used ways for building out this growth rocket include:

Performance marketing, e.g., Facebook Ads, Google Ads, print ads, and TV.
Sales, e.g., outbound sales, inbound sales
Company-generated content e.g., newsletters, social media posts
2. The Retention Growth Loop
The core retention loop in the customer factory, or happy customer loop, is used to drive customers back into your customer factory. While this is critical for making happy customers and maximizing your customer lifetime, that alone doesn’t create a sustainable growth loop.


You can turn the retention loop into a sustainable growth loop if you can utilize derivative assets created through usage by your existing customers to attract new customers.

Content and data are typically the commonly used propellents here.

Some ways to build out this engine include:

User-generated content e.g., YouTube, Pinterest
Reviews e.g., Yelp
Data e.g., Waze
3. The Referral Growth Loop
This growth loop is built on referrals where you use your existing users to drive new users into your customer factory. Happy users/customers are the propellents here.


Building a referral growth loop can take many forms:

Word-of-mouth
Referral programs
Inviting friends/team members
If you successfully find a possible growth rocket candidate, you then double down on optimizing your growth rocket engine and realize a scalable business model.

Key Takeaways
Traction is the goal.
Traction is the output of a working business model.
Traction is customer throughput.
Build your customer factory in stages as batches of customers.
Each stage is wired differently to deliver the required throughput at that stage.
Focus on constraints to improve throughput until you’re ready to move to the next stage.
Each stage is repeatable.
Achieve repeatability before pursuing scalability.
‍
Entrepreneurs need to be able to simultaneously pitch a big long-term vision while staying grounded in short-term actions to move their vision forward.

Product Roadmaps have traditionally been used for rollout planning. But product roadmaps assume you know what you’ll be building for the next 18-24 months, which you don’t.More importantly, they put you back in the old world of waterfall planning, where any future deviation from the plan will be seen as a sign of weakness.

How do you reconcile making actionable plans under conditions of extreme uncertainty?

In today's issue, I'll show you how.

Meet the Traction Roadmap.
Unlike a product roadmap, a traction roadmap isn’t output-oriented but outcome-oriented. As the goal of a startup is building a repeatable and scalable business model, the only measurable outcome that matters is traction.

A Traction Roadmap charts key traction milestones in your journey from idea to building a repeatable and scalable business model.

How to Create a Traction Roadmap
There are two recipes for creating a traction roadmap:

👨‍🍳The Rapid Traction Roadmap
👨‍🍳The Customer Factory Traction Roadmap
Let's cover each.

1. 👨‍🍳The Rapid Traction Roadmap
This recipe uses a Fermi (order of magnitude) Estimate to pick a meaningful Minimum Success Criteria (MSC) goal, which you then convert into a customer throughput (or traction) metric.

I outlined how to do these first two steps in this issue, where I covered the Rapid Viability Test.

Creating a traction roadmap from your 3-year minimum success criteria goal is simply extrapolating backward using a growth rate. I recommend using a 10x/year growth rate in classic Fermi style.


Contrary to common belief, 10x'ing isn't just for hyper-growth startups. All startups can 10x two or more times in the first three years, provided you start counting from customer #1.

Don't believe me? Work the numbers out for yourself.

2. 👨‍🍳The Customer Factory Traction Roadmap
While Fermi Estimation is highly effective for quick ballparking, if your model survives the Rapid Viability Test, I recommend creating a more accurate roadmap next using the 👨‍🍳The Customer Factory Traction Roadmap recipe.

You aren't restricted to power of 10 estimation (or 10x growth) here, and this model uses three additional metrics: customer acquisition, churn, and referral rate assumptions to chart your Traction Roadmap.

Pitch Your Traction Roadmap with a Now-Next-Later Rollout Plan
Janna Bastow's Now-Next-Later product roadmap inspired the Now-Next-Later Rollout Plan. The basic idea is viewing your traction roadmap using three-time horizons and formulating a go-to-market (GTM) plan for each time horizon.

As can be expected,

your now plan should be the most concrete,
your next plan less so, and
your later plan the fuzziest.
Now-next-later planning intends to stretch your thinking and plan around time frames versus specific deadlines. Your time-frames are subject to whether you currently have traction (customers) or not.

For products at the ideation stage:
I recommend using yearly time frames to set your time horizons.

This breaks your Minimum Success Criteria into three milestones: Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 — that roughly align with the three distinct segments of the hockey-stick curve:

a flat section,
followed by an increasingly steeper section
until you hit a noticeable inflection point when the curve shoots up.
yearly-now-next-later.png
For products with some traction already:
I recommend using progressive doubling to set your time horizons.

Set your first time-horizon (NOW) to +90-days (3 months). Why 90 days? Because it's long enough to increase traction while short enough to drive a healthy sense of urgency.

Set your second time-horizon (NEXT) to +180 days (6 months) from NOW. This stretches your planning to your next two 90-day cycles, putting you out nine months.

Set your third time-horizon (LATER) to +360 days (12 months) from NEXT. This stretches you even further, putting you 18 months out.

Let’s see a real-world example of a Now-Next-Later Rollout Plan.

Case Study: The Secret Tesla Master Plan
I’ve previously written about how Tesla launched their first car four times faster than any car company by thinking outside the box — utilizing a 👨‍🍳Wizard of Oz recipe of licensing versus building an entire car:


However, did you ever wonder why they chose an expensive sports car over a more affordable one? Wouldn’t a more affordable car, like a Ford Mustang, sell more cars?

While positioning was part of the answer, the real reason was that they were following a deliberate 3-part strategy that Elon Musk teased (and blogged about) in 2006:

Build sports car (sell hundreds)
Use that money to build an affordable car (sell thousands)
Use that money to build an even more affordable car (sell tens of thousands+)
Ten years later, he explained the plan during the Model 3 launch event:

How would he have pitched his vision and rollout plan in 2006 before any cars were built (or even designed)?

Big Vision
…the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution.

Traction Roadmap
Sell 500,000 electric cars by 2020.


NOW Story (Most Concrete)
Build a low-volume, high-price sports EV to lower demand while de-risking battery.

Use the 👨‍🍳Wizard of Oz recipe to license an existing sports car and fit a battery.
List possible sports car companies to approach
Run a pre-order campaign (demo-sell-build)
Hire scientists/engineers to work on building a battery

NEXT Story (Fuzzy)
Build a mid-volume, less high-price EV sedan to increase demand while de-risking going mainstream risks.

Build a sedan (design and product features largely unknown)
Build/acquire a factory
Hire automotive engineers and designers
Design and build a sedan
Improve battery
Build infrastructure for charging, selling, and servicing cars.

LATER Story (Most fuzzy)
Build a high-volume, affordable compact EV to maximize demand after addressing most starting risks.

Build a compact car at a $30-40k price point (design unknown)
Leverage learning from stages 1 and 2 to scale






Ash Maurya’s "Traction-First" feature building is a lean methodology that prioritizes validated learning and customer demand over the raw speed of shipping code. It shifts the focus from "Build-Measure-Learn" to "Sell-Build-Measure-Learn," advocating for validation through user action (like pre-orders or usage) before investing in full development. Key Aspects of Traction-First Feature Building: Sell Before You Build (Demo-Sell-Build): Instead of asking "Would you use this?" (which gets false positives), this approach asks "Will you pre-order or sign up for this?".Customer Actions > Words: The core tenet is to measure what customers do (behavior) rather than what they say.Minimal Marketable Feature (MMF): Features are broken down into the smallest possible version that provides value. A true MMF is something you could confidently announce in a newsletter.Continuous Deployment + Feature Flippers: Code is deployed to production but kept hidden, allowing for safe, gradual rollouts to select customers to validate the feature qualitatively before a full release.80/20 Rule for Features: Focus 80% of effort on optimizing and measuring existing features, and 20% on new features, to avoid building a product with too many unused features.Kanban for Feature Lifecycles: Features are tracked on a Kanban board from "Understand Problem" \(\rightarrow \) "Define Solution" \(\rightarrow \) "Validate Qualitatively" \(\rightarrow \) "Verify Quantitatively". The 4-Stage Feature Workflow: Understand Problem: Before writing code, run interviews to define the "why" behind a feature request.Define Solution: Create and demo low-fidelity mockups or prototypes to validate the solution.Validate Qualitatively: Use continuous deployment to push code to a small, select group of users to ensure it actually solves their problem.Verify Quantitatively: Roll out to all users and monitor metrics to confirm it impacts the "macro metric" (e.g., increased revenue or retention). Core Metric: The rate at which you acquire, retain, and grow customers (Traction) is the only true measure of progress, not the number of features built.
