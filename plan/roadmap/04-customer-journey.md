Steve Jobs, the genius behind Apple’s one-of-a-kind customer experience, said, “You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology, not the other way around.”

Nowadays, a clear vision and strategy for customer interactions is no longer an optional “nice-to-have”—it’s essential. As you refine your customer experience, a customer journey map is one of the most powerful ways to understand your current state and future state.

Want to create a shared vision for a customer experience that is ready to scale with your organization? Check out our customer journey map example, that’s easy to edit and share with your team.

A customer journey map is a diagram that shows the process your customers go through in interacting with your business, such as an experience on the website, a brick and mortar experience, a service, a product, or a mix of those things.

What is a customer journey map?
A customer journey map is a visual representation of a customer’s experience with your brand. These visuals tell a story about how a customer moves through each phase of interaction and experiences each phase. Your customer journey map should include touchpoints and moments of truth, but also potential customer feelings, such as frustration or confusion, and any actions you want the customer to take.

Customer journey maps are often based on a timeline of events, such as a customer’s first visit on your website and the way they progress towards their first in-product experience, then purchase, onboarding emails, cancellation, etc. 

Your customer journey maps may need to be tailored to your business or product, but the best way to identify and refine these phases is to actually talk to your customers. Research your target audiences to understand how they make decisions, decide to purchase, etc. Without an essential understanding of your customers and their needs, a customer map will not lead you to success. But, a well-constructed and researched customer journey map can give you the insights to drastically improve your business’s customer experience.

The benefits of customer journey mapping
Customer journey mapping is a powerful tool for uncovering insights into your customer experience, driving business goals, and building resilience in a changing market. In a 2022 report, Hanover Research found that 94% of businesses said their customer journey maps help them develop new products and services to match customer needs. Another 91% said their maps drove sales. 

But understanding a customer’s journey across your entire organization does so much more than increase your revenue. It enables you to discover how to be consistent when it comes to providing a positive customer experience and retaining customer loyalty. 

This was especially evident in recent years as top of improving marketing, customer journey maps emerged as a valuable way to understand evolving buyer behavior. In fact, 1 in 3 businesses used customer journey maps to help them navigate the changing landscape during the pandemic.

When done correctly, customer journey mapping helps to:

Increase customer engagement through channel optimization.
Identify and optimize moments of truth in the CX.
Eliminate ineffective touchpoints.
Shift from a company to a customer-focused perspective.
Break down silos between departments and close interdepartmental gaps.
Target specific customer personas with marketing campaigns relevant to their identity.
Understand the circumstances that may have produced irregularities in existing quantitative data.
Assign ownership of various customer touchpoints to increase employee accountability.
Make it possible to assess the ROI of future UX/CX investments.
Following the process outlined above, customer mapping can put your organization on a new trajectory of success. Yet, according to Hanover Research, only 47% of companies currently have a process in place for mapping customer journeys. Making the investment to map your customer journey and solidify that process as part of your company’s DNA can result in significant advantages in your competitive landscape, making your solution the go-to option that customers love.

How to create a customer journey map
Customer journey maps can become complicated unless you keep them focused. Although you may target multiple personas, choose just one persona and one customer scenario to research and visualize at a time. If you aren’t sure what your personas or scenarios might be, gather some colleagues and try an affinity diagram in Lucidchart to generate ideas.

1. Set goals
Without a goal, it will be difficult to determine whether your customer journey map will translate to a tangible impact on your customers and your business. You will likely need to identify existing—and future—buyers so you can set goals specifically for those audiences at each stage of their experience.

Consider gathering the key stakeholders within your company—many of whom likely touch different points of the customer experience. To set a logical and attainable goal, cross-functional teamwork is essential. Gather unique perspectives and insights about each part of the existing customer journey and where improvements are needed, and how those improvements will be measured.

Pro Tip: If you don’t already have them in place, create buyer personas to help you focus your customer journey map on the specific types of buyers you’re optimizing for.

2. Conduct persona research
Flesh out as much information as possible about the persona your customer journey map is based on. Depending on the maturity of your business, you may only have a handful of records, reports, or other pre-existing data about the target persona. You can compile your preliminary findings to draft what you think the customer journey may look like.

However, the most insightful data you can collect is from real customers or prospective customers—those who have actually interacted with your brand. Gather meaningful customer data in any of the following ways:

Conduct interviews.
Talk to employees who regularly interact with customers.
Email a survey to existing users.
Scour customer support and complaint logs.
Pull clips from recorded call center conversations.
Monitor discussions about your company that occur on social media.
Leverage web analytics.
Gather Net Promoter Score (NPS) data.
Look for information that references:

How customers initially found your brand
When/if customers purchase or cancel
How easy or difficult they found your website to use
What problems your brand did or didn’t solve
Collecting both qualitative and quantitative information throughout your research process ensures your business makes data-driven decisions based on the voice of real customers. To assist when conducting persona research, use one of our user persona templates.

3. Define customer touchpoints
Customer touchpoints make up the majority of your customer journey map. They are how and where customers interact with and experience your brand. As you research and plot your touchpoints, be sure to include information addressing elements of action, emotion, and potential challenges. 

The number and type of touchpoints on your customer journey map will depend on the type of business. For example, a customer’s journey with a SaaS company will be inherently different than that of a coffee shop experience. Simply choose the touchpoints which accurately reflect a customer’s journey with your brand.

After you define your touchpoints, you can then start arranging them on your customer journey map.

4. Map the current state
Create what you believe is your as-is state of the customer journey, the current customer experience. Use a visual workspace like Lucidchart, and start organizing your data and touchpoints. Prioritize the right content over aesthetics. Invite input from the stakeholders and build your customer journey map collaboratively to ensure accuracy. 

Again, there is no “correct” way to format your customer journey map, but for each phase along the journey timeline, include the touchpoints, actions, channels, and assigned ownership of a touchpoint (sales, customer service, marketing, etc.). Then, customize your diagram design with images, color, and shape variation to better visualize the different actions, emotions, transitions, etc. at a glance.

Mapping your current state will also help you start to identify gaps or red flags in the experience. Collaborators can comment directly on different parts of your diagram in Lucidchart, so it’s clear exactly where there’s room for improvement.

5. Map future states
Now that you’ve visualized the current state of the customer journey, your map will probably show some gaps in your CX, information overlap, poor transitions between stages, and significant pain points or obstacles for customers.

Use hotspots and layers in Lucidchart to easily map out potential solutions and quickly compare the current state of the customer journey with the ideal future state. Present your findings company-wide to bring everyone up to speed on the areas that need to be improved, with a clear roadmap for expected change and how their roles will play a part in improving the customer journey.

Story Mapping
What is Story Mapping?
Story mapping is a method for arranging user stories to create a more holistic view of how they fit into the overall user experience. Arranged on a horizontal axis, the fundamental steps of the customer journey (sometimes labeled as epics, sometimes not) are arranged in chronological order based on when a user would perform the particular task relative to their overall workflow with the product.

Individual user stories are arranged beneath the more significant steps they roll up under. Thus, when a story map is complete, you can see all of the ways a user might interact with a product in a single, logical view that progresses from the first interaction to completing the overall user objective.

story-mapping

Story mapping is usually done on a wall (or floor) using sticky notes or index cards and many tapes. Usually, the entire team identifies and agrees on the primary steps of the user journey and then assigns user stories beneath them. Finally, each story is discussed, so there’s no doubt about what a story actually is, its purpose, and how it fits into the overall scheme of things.

Why Use Story Mapping?
Story mapping serves a few key purposes. First, it paints a full picture of how a product is used, often lost in the “not seeing the forest for the trees” reality of feature development since most teams focus on specific tasks and not the “big picture” most of the time. Second, it can also identify holes in functionality or areas to focus on since they can visually highlight gaps in the user experience. Finally, a story map can also be an excellent tool for prioritizing, both for an MVP (the minimum required to complete the overall goal) and subsequent releases (what’s missing that must/should/could be there).

Of course, the most common usage of story mapping utilizes it as an alternative to “flat” backlog management, where each item is viewed in a vacuum instead of in a visual, big-picture context. Grooming a backlog with no context might work, but you miss out on the chance to view each item’s connection and importance to the overall journey.

What’s the History of Story Mapping?
Jeff Patton is credited as the inventor of story mapping, and he has written the book on it (User Story Mapping). This invention was born out of a realization that written documents are prone to misinterpretation while having an actual conversation was far likelier to lead to a shared understanding and delivery of a product that meets the needs of its intended users.

Story mapping aims to uncover the details of what is required to deliver customer value and avoid backlog grooming sessions that don’t fully engage the audience, and consider each item out of context.

While Jeff started introducing the concept to the world as far back as 2005, it wasn’t officially dubbed “story mapping” until 2008. However, in the decade since its introduction, it has been adopted by many agile adherents and incorporated into multiple tools and software solutions for product development teams.

How Does Story Mapping Work?
The backbone of the story map is the core set of steps a user must work through to accomplish their goal. Beneath each step are the details for each of the larger steps (the “big” step might be “checkout,” while smaller steps below could include inputting/selecting the shipping address, select a shipping method, inputting/selecting a payment method, confirming shipment, sending shipment details, etc.).

What really makes story mapping work is its reliance on visuals as part of an interactive, collaborative process. Reviewing a PowerPoint or scrolling through JIRA is a passive experience that, at best, will inspire a strong reaction from the audience—I agree, I disagree, that’s wrong, etc.—but seldom leads to a real conversation.

Story mapping is inclusive and interactive.
Story mapping invites everyone to “get their hands dirty” because the map is built in real-time, in-person, and collaboratively. As stories are being mapped to the overall workflow, there is ample opportunity to challenge, add, and edit, all relative to the overall goal and not focusing on a discrete task or item.

By working on the story map together, you create a shared understanding. Everyone who exits the session is on the same page regarding what’s important, why it’s important, and how it fits into the overarching goal. And since you’re not allowed to “move on” until each user story and how it plugs into the overall narrative is fully understood by everyone, you’ll avoid countless wasted hours of developers and designers creating things they “think” meet the objectives yet fall short in reality.

Story maps are never “done.”
Story maps are continual works in progress. As steps are completed, new ones get prioritized, and additional steps are added. Meanwhile, user feedback and competitive analysis uncover new requirements. So whether you leave your story map up/out and update it or rebuild it from scratch periodically, the backbone and key steps remain part of the process.

Reassessing your story map regularly is healthy and recommended. You can either leave it up on the wall permanently, or you can periodically recreate it, which in and of itself can be an insightful exercise. However you do it, the perspective gained from the process is invaluable, both in optimizing the prioritization of user stories and from the discussions and revelations that come from discussing each story with the entire team.

When Should You Use Story Mapping?
The great thing about story mapping is that you can start using it during any phase of the product life cycle.

Working on an MVP? A story map is a great way to identify the minimum functionality you need to test your concept. It will prevent you from “forgetting” about critical parts of the user experience you might have otherwise overlooked.
Trying to figure out how to improve on version 1.0? A story map can visually display all of the potential enhancements you could add and help your team have quality conversations about what will most impact your users.
Managing your backlog a growing concern? Story mapping helps you tame the backlog by giving each item some context and forcing prioritization and grouping with a big-picture view; plus, it can highlight gaps you might have never noticed otherwise.
Branching out with a new product extension? A story map will illustrate what you already have and the missing pieces you’ll need to make the new functionality work just as well as your current offering.
Regardless of whether your product is still theoretical or has been kicking around for decades, story mapping starts with personas—you must know who will be using your product and what they’re trying to accomplish. This drives everything in the future, as you’re envisioning how they’ll use the finished product before you’ve even built it.

And as your thinking matures, you’ll need to apply multiple personas to the same story map, as different types of users are trying to accomplish multiple things with your product. If your journey isn’t accommodating them all, this process will quickly identify your product’s shortcomings in these new scenarios.

What Are a Few Ways to Use Story Mapping to Prioritize Roadmap Initiatives?
Story maps provide excellent input to the roadmapping process. With every potential feature already mapped out and prioritized, you can essentially cluster the highest priority features into releases based on your team’s bandwidth and release cadence.

1. Sizing things up
Complete your story map with the smaller items arranged top-to-bottom based on importance. Then, collaborate with product development on assigning each item a relative level of effort (LOE). This could be person-hours, days, or weeks, or you can utilize some other system that gives the product leader a sense of how long each thing will take.

This is also the appropriate time to cluster any items that may benefit from being built simultaneously because it will increase efficiency. While this shouldn’t always dictate that all related items should be built simultaneously, it is one more tool to avoid prioritization and scheduling features in a vacuum.

Now that you can visualize both what is important for each major step in the backbone and how big of an effort each one requires, you’ll need to know how much actual work fits into a given release. For example, you may have a development team of five and a release cycle that where each developer has 50 person-hours of development time for new features, giving you 250 hours to work with.

2. Slotting things in
Now armed with your development “budget,” the ranking of each item, and the LOE cost of each item, you have enough information to start slotting items into releases for your roadmap. At this point, the story map has already done a lot of the heavy lifting, and you’re essentially working top-down from the backbone to see how much you can fit into each release.

The “art” comes in deciding how to allocate items to releases. You can take an egalitarian approach where each major step gets a relatively equal number of sub-items each release, or you can decide to focus on a specific step or two for a given cycle.

The latter approach may make sense for a product in its infancy (when you’re just trying to get a baseline of functionality into place) or when a product is quite mature. You’re just focused on iterative improvements throughout the process—taking a deep dive on a particular step or two (such as focusing on the shopping cart” may be a better fit for a product that’s already working but is ripe for significant enhancement and can benefit from concentrating on one area at a time.

3. Defining outcomes
Once you have decided what to include in each release, it should map to a particular outcome. In short, what should this release accomplish in terms of user experience? For example, it could be frictionless account creation or receiving personalized product recommendations.

Since every sprint has a desired outcome, it’s pretty easy to determine whether the sprint is successful. So, for example, if the objective was that users can now pick what color they want their widget to be, there’s a binary measurement of whether that outcome was achieved instead of celebrating that the color wheel shipped.

4. Iterating in plain sight
When a feature is too big for a single sprint,  construct it iteratively. Don’t build pieces that won’t function until several sprints into the future. Instead, build the bare necessities first. Then, build out on that skeleton during each sprint while learning from real-world usage of the first iteration.

This allows you to quickly get that new functionality to market while still improving your design and execution on user feedback. It also cuts down on sprints that “lay foundations” but don’t deliver any actual value to end-users.

Story Mapping is One of Many Prioritization Tools
Story mapping is an opportunity to achieve many objectives that product leaders often struggle with. You can communicate big-picture goals and objectives without “lecturing” to your coworkers. You can create a collaborative environment that engages everyone to participate in product strategy. You can tap the potential ideas and concepts that might not have otherwise seen the light of day. And you can achieve consensus and understanding of objectives before your team writes a single line of code.

However, story mapping isn’t fast—you’re mapping every user story after all—and you’re going to need the right physical space to do it. You might have to convince management that this is a worthwhile use of everyone’s time instead of their usually scheduled programming.

But at the end of the day, if your product isn’t helping customers complete their journey, they’re going to take their journey somewhere else or cancel it altogether. A story map aligns everyone with that objective and creates a context-rich environment where it’s easy to see where resources should go.
