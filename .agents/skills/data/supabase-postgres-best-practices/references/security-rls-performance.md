## Optimize RLS Policies for Performance

Poorly written RLS policies can cause severe performance issues. Use subqueries and indexes strategically.

**Incorrect (function called for every row):**

```sql
create policy orders_policy on orders
  for select to authenticated
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);  -- auth.uid() called per row!

-- With 1M rows, auth.uid() is called 1M times
```

**Correct (wrap functions in SELECT):**

```sql
create policy orders_policy on orders
  for select
  to authenticated
  using ((select auth.uid()) = user_id);  -- Called once via initPlan, cached

-- Supabase benchmarks show 99.94% improvement (from 178ms to 0.1ms on 500K rows)
-- The (SELECT ...) wrapper causes Postgres to evaluate as an initPlan subquery,
-- computed once per statement rather than once per row.
```

Use security definer functions for complex checks:

```sql
-- Create helper function (runs as definer, bypasses RLS)
create or replace function is_team_member(team_id bigint)
returns boolean
language sql
security definer
set search_path = ''
as $$
  select exists (
    select 1 from public.team_members
    where team_id = $1 and user_id = (select auth.uid())
  );
$$;

-- Use in policy (indexed lookup, not per-row check)
create policy team_orders_policy on orders
  using ((select is_team_member(team_id)));
```

Always add indexes on columns used in RLS policies:

```sql
create index orders_user_id_idx on orders (user_id);
```
