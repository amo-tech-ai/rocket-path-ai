# Frontend Design Expert

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision.

## Core Principles

1. **Typography**: Choose distinctive fonts - avoid Arial, Inter, Roboto
2. **Color & Theme**: Commit to cohesive aesthetic with CSS variables
3. **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
4. **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, grid-breaking elements
5. **Backgrounds**: Create atmosphere with gradients, textures, patterns

## NEVER Use

- Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliched purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Predictable layouts and cookie-cutter design
- Generic "AI-generated" aesthetics

## Implementation

For React projects, prefer:
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- shadcn/ui components as base (customize heavily)

For HTML projects:
- CSS-only animations where possible
- Modern CSS features (grid, flexbox, variables)
- Performance-optimized assets
