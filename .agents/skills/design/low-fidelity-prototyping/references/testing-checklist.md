# Lo-Fi Usability Testing Checklist

## Pre-Test Preparation

- [ ] Define 3-5 specific tasks for users to attempt
- [ ] Prepare prototype screens/cards in correct order
- [ ] Write a brief intro script explaining the lo-fi format
- [ ] Set up note-taking template (task, observation, severity)
- [ ] Recruit 3-5 representative users
- [ ] Prepare consent form if recording

## Intro Script Template

> "Thanks for helping us today. We're testing an early concept for [product/feature].
> This is intentionally rough - we're testing the idea, not the visual design.
> There are no wrong answers. If something is confusing, that's valuable feedback.
> Please think aloud as you go - tell us what you expect to happen before you act."

## During Each Task

- [ ] Read the task scenario aloud
- [ ] Note the user's first action (first-click accuracy)
- [ ] Record hesitation points (>3 seconds of uncertainty)
- [ ] Note verbal confusion or questions
- [ ] Track whether the task was completed successfully
- [ ] Note any unexpected paths taken
- [ ] Ask "What did you expect to happen?" at confusion points

## Post-Task Questions

1. "On a scale of 1-5, how easy was that task?"
2. "What was confusing or unclear?"
3. "What did you expect to see that wasn't there?"
4. "Where would you look for [feature] if it wasn't where you found it?"

## Post-Session Analysis

- [ ] Tally task success rates across all participants
- [ ] List common confusion points (appeared in 2+ sessions)
- [ ] Identify missing screens or steps
- [ ] Note terminology that caused confusion
- [ ] Prioritize issues: critical (blocks task) / major (causes delay) / minor (causes hesitation)

## Iteration Triggers

Make changes to the prototype when:
- 2+ users fail the same task
- 3+ users express the same confusion
- Users consistently look in the wrong place first
- A critical flow has <60% success rate

## Output Template

```
## Test Results: [Feature/Flow Name]
Date: [date]
Participants: [count]

### Task Success Rates
| Task | Success | Partial | Failed |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| ...  | ...     | ...     | ...    |

### Critical Issues
1. [Issue] - [count] users affected - [recommendation]

### Major Issues
1. [Issue] - [count] users affected - [recommendation]

### Observations
- [Notable quotes or behaviors]

### Recommended Changes
1. [Change] - Addresses [issue]
