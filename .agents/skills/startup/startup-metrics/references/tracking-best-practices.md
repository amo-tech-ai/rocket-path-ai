# Metrics Tracking Best Practices

## Data Infrastructure

**Requirements:**
- Single source of truth (analytics platform)
- Real-time or daily updates
- Automated calculations
- Historical tracking

**Tools:**
- Mixpanel, Amplitude (product analytics)
- ChartMogul, Baremetrics (SaaS metrics)
- Looker, Tableau (BI dashboards)

## Reporting Cadence

| Cadence | What to Track |
|---------|--------------|
| Daily | MRR, active users, sign-ups, conversions |
| Weekly | Growth rates, retention cohorts, sales pipeline |
| Monthly | Full metric suite, board reporting, investor updates |
| Quarterly | Trend analysis, benchmarking, strategy review |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Vanity Metrics** — Focus on actionable metrics tied to value, not totals
2. **Too Many Metrics** — Track 5-7 core metrics intensely, not 50 loosely
3. **Ignoring Unit Economics** — CAC and LTV matter even at seed stage
4. **Not Segmenting** — Break down by customer segment, channel, cohort
5. **Gaming Metrics** — Optimize for real business outcomes, not dashboard numbers

## Vanity Metrics to Avoid

| Vanity Metric | Better Alternative |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Total downloads | Activated users |
| Page views | Conversion rate |
| Registered users | Active users |
| Social followers | Engagement rate |
| Cumulative revenue | MoM growth |

## Quick Start

1. **Identify business model** — SaaS, marketplace, consumer, B2B
2. **Choose 5-7 core metrics** — Based on stage and model
3. **Establish tracking** — Set up analytics and dashboards
4. **Calculate unit economics** — CAC, LTV, payback
5. **Set targets** — Use benchmarks for goals
6. **Review regularly** — Weekly for core metrics
7. **Share with team** — Align on goals and progress
