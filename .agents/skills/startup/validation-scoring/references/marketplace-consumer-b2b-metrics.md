# Marketplace, Consumer & B2B Metrics

## Marketplace Metrics

### GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)

```
GMV = Σ (Transaction Value)
GMV Growth Rate = (Current GMV - Prior GMV) / Prior GMV
```

Target: 20%+ MoM early-stage

### Take Rate

```
Take Rate = Net Revenue / GMV
```

| Type | Typical Take Rate |
|------|------------------|
| Payment processors | 2-3% |
| E-commerce marketplaces | 10-20% |
| Service marketplaces | 15-25% |
| High-value B2B | 5-15% |

### Marketplace Liquidity

- **Fill Rate:** % of requests that result in transaction (target > 80%)
- **Repeat Rate:** % of users who transact multiple times (target > 60%)
- **Time to Transaction:** How long from listing to sale/match

### Supply/Demand Balance

Track relative growth of both sides. Warning signs:
- Too much supply → low fill rates, frustrated suppliers
- Too much demand → long wait times, frustrated customers
- Goal: balanced growth (1:1 ratio ideal)

## Consumer / Mobile Metrics

### Engagement

```
DAU/MAU = Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users
```

| DAU/MAU | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| > 50% | Exceptional (daily habit) |
| 20-50% | Good |
| < 20% | Weak engagement |

### Retention Curves

| Retention | Benchmark |
|-----------|-----------|
| Day 1 | Baseline |
| Day 7 | 15-25% good |
| Day 30 | > 40% excellent, 25-40% good, < 25% weak |

Flattening curve = good (habitual users). Steep decline = poor PMF.

### Viral Coefficient (K-Factor)

```
K-Factor = Invites per User × Invite Conversion Rate
```

| K-Factor | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| > 1.0 | Viral growth |
| 0.5-1.0 | Strong referrals |
| < 0.5 | Weak virality |

## B2B Metrics

### Sales Efficiency

Win Rate = Deals Won / Total Opportunities

| SMB | 30-60 days |
| Mid-market | 60-120 days |
| Enterprise | 120-270 days |

### Pipeline Metrics

```
Pipeline Coverage = Total Pipeline Value / Quota
```

Target: 3-5x coverage

**Conversion Rates by Stage:**
- Lead → Opportunity: 10-20%
- Opportunity → Demo: 50-70%
- Demo → Proposal: 30-50%
- Proposal → Close: 20-40%

### ACV (Average Contract Value)

```
