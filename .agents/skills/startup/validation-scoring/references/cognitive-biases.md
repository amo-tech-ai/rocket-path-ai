# Cognitive Bias Defenses for Founders

Six biases that derail startup validation (from Siift.ai research + synthesis of 18 frameworks).

## The Six Validation Killers

| Bias | How It Hurts Validation | Defense |
|------|------------------------|---------|
| **Confirmation Bias** | Seek data that confirms the idea, ignore disconfirming evidence | Pre-register pass/fail thresholds. Actively seek counter-evidence. Include a "why this might fail" section in every analysis. |
| **Optimism Bias** | Overestimate market size, underestimate costs, inflate timelines | Use conservative (P10) scenarios alongside base (P50). Require bottom-up market sizing, not just top-down. |
| **Sunk Cost Fallacy** | Keep building despite negative evidence because "we've invested too much" | Set kill criteria before experiments. Track cumulative spend vs. signal strength. Recommend explicit KILL when score < 40. |
| **Survivorship Bias** | Copy successful startups without understanding the 90% that failed | Show full competitive landscape (failed + active). Analyze why similar ideas failed, not just why winners won. |
| **Anchoring** | First data point dominates all subsequent thinking | Show confidence ranges, not single numbers. Present multiple estimates from different sources. |
| **Bandwagon Effect** | Chase trends without differentiation ("AI for X" without unfair advantage) | Score unfair advantage independently. Ask: "What do you have that a well-funded competitor can't copy in 6 months?" |

## Defense Strategies

### 1. Pre-Registration
Write down pass/fail criteria BEFORE running any experiment. This is the single most effective bias defense.

### 2. Devil's Advocate
For every key assumption, actively argue the opposite:
- "What if the market is 10x smaller than estimated?"
- "What if customers say they want this but won't pay?"
- "What if a competitor launches this feature next month?"

### 3. Evidence Grading
Not all evidence is equal. Grade every data point:

| Grade | Source | Weight |
|:-----:|--------|:------:|
| A | Customer payment, usage data, signed LOI | High |
| B | Customer interview (behavioral question), waitlist signup | Medium |
| C | Survey response, industry report, expert opinion | Low |
| D | Founder intuition, analogy to other markets | Very Low |

### 4. Counter-Signal Requirement
For every positive finding, require at least one counter-signal:
- Market is large → but growth is slowing in segment X
- Customers express pain → but current workarounds are "good enough" for 60%
- No direct competitors → but adjacent players could enter easily

### 5. Time-Boxing
Set hard time limits on validation:
- If no Level 3+ signal (signup/payment) within 4 weeks of testing → formal pivot review
- If 3+ experiments fail consecutively → mandatory kill/pivot decision
- Maximum 8 weeks from idea to go/no-go decision

## Red Flags in Founder Reasoning

Watch for these phrases — they often signal bias:

| Phrase | Likely Bias | Better Question |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| "Everyone I talked to loved it" | Confirmation | "How many said they'd pay $X today?" |
| "The market is $50B" | Optimism / Anchoring | "What's the bottom-up SAM for your ICP?" |
| "We've been working on this for a year" | Sunk Cost | "What's the signal strength from experiments?" |
| "Look at how Uber did it" | Survivorship | "What about the 50 ride-sharing apps that failed?" |
| "AI is the future, everyone needs this" | Bandwagon | "What's your unfair advantage vs. other AI tools?" |
| "We just need more time" | Sunk Cost + Optimism | "What specific evidence would change the verdict?" |
