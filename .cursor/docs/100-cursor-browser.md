Browser
Agent can control a web browser to test applications, visually edit layouts and styles, audit accessibility, convert designs into code, and more. With full access to console logs and network traffic, Agent can debug issues and automate comprehensive testing workflows.

Agent can control a web browser to test applications, audit accessibility, convert designs into code, and more.
For enterprise customers, browser controls are governed by MCP allowlist or denylist.

Native integration
Agent displays browser actions like screenshots and actions in the chat, as well as the browser window itself either in a separate window or an inline pane.

We've optimized the browser tools to be more efficient and reduce token usage, as well as:

Efficient log handling: Browser logs are written to files that Agent can grep and selectively read. Instead of summarizing verbose output after every action, Agent reads only the relevant lines it needs. This preserves full context while minimizing token usage.
Visual feedback with images: Screenshots are integrated directly with the file reading tool, so Agent actually sees the browser state as images rather than relying on text descriptions. This enables better understanding of visual layouts and UI elements.
Smart prompting: Agent receives additional context about browser logs, including total line counts and preview snippets, helping it make informed decisions about what to inspect.
Development server awareness: Agent is prompted to detect running development servers and use the correct ports instead of starting duplicate servers or guessing port numbers.
You can use Browser without installing or configuring any external tools.

Design sidebar
The browser includes a design sidebar for modifying your site directly in Cursor. Design and code simultaneously with real-time visual adjustments.

Visual editing capabilities
The sidebar provides powerful visual editing controls:

Position and layout: Move and rearrange elements on the page. Change flex direction, alignment, and grid layouts.
Dimensions: Adjust width, height, padding, and margins with precise pixel values.
Colors: Update colors from your design system or add new gradients. Access color tokens through a visual picker.
Appearance: Experiment with shadows, opacity, and border radius using visual sliders.
Theme testing: Test your designs across light and dark themes instantly.
Applying changes
When your visual adjustments match your vision, click the apply button to trigger an agent that updates your codebase. The agent translates your visual changes into the appropriate code modifications.

You can also select multiple elements across your site and describe changes in text. Agents kick off in parallel, and your changes appear live on the page after hot-reload.

Session persistence
Browser state persists between Agent sessions based on your workspace. This means:

Cookies: Authentication cookies and session data remain available across browser sessions
Local Storage: Data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage persists
IndexedDB: Database content is retained between sessions
The browser context is isolated per workspace, ensuring that different projects maintain separate storage and cookie states.

Use cases
Web development workflow
Browser integrates into web development workflows alongside tools like Figma and Linear. See the Web Development cookbook for a complete guide on using Browser with design systems, project management tools, and component libraries.

Accessibility improvements
Agent can audit and improve web accessibility to meet WCAG compliance standards.

@browser Check color contrast ratios, verify semantic HTML and ARIA labels, test keyboard navigation, and identify missing alt text

Security
Browser runs as a secure web view and is controlled using an MCP server running as an extension. Multiple layers protect you from unauthorized access and malicious actions. Cursor's Browser integrations have also been reviewed by multiple external security auditors.

Authentication and isolation
The browser implements several security measures:

Token authentication: Agent layout generates a random authentication token before each browser session starts
Tab isolation: Each browser tab receives a unique random ID to prevent cross-tab interference
Session-based security: Tokens regenerate for each new browser session
Tool approval
Browser tools require your approval by default. Review each action before Agent executes it. This prevents unexpected navigation, data submission, or script execution.

You can configure approval settings in Agent Settings. Available modes:

Mode	Description
Manual approval	Review and approve each browser action individually (recommended)
Allow-listed actions	Actions matching your allow list run automatically; others require approval
Auto-run	All browser actions execute immediately without approval (use with caution)
Allow and block lists
Browser tools integrate with Cursor's security guardrails. Configure which browser actions run automatically:

Allow list: Specify trusted actions that skip approval prompts
Block list: Define actions that should always be blocked
Access settings through: Cursor Settings → Chat → Auto-Run
The allow/block list system provides best-effort protection. AI behavior can be unpredictable due to prompt injection and other issues. Review auto-approved actions regularly.

Never use auto-run mode with untrusted code or unfamiliar websites. Agent could execute malicious scripts or submit sensitive data without your knowledge.

Browser context
The browser window's behavior changes based on where you run it:

Context	Behavior
Chrome	Opens an isolated Chrome process for full-screen browsing
Browser Tab	Opens as a pane within Cursor
Both contexts allow the agent to control the browser using a set of MCP tools.

Switching between Chrome and Browser Tab
You can switch between Chrome and Browser Tab modes in your Cursor settings:

Open Cursor Settings (or press Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
Navigate to Tools & MCP → Browser Automation
Select your preferred browser context (Chrome or Browser Tab)
Changes take effect immediately for new browser sessions.

Recommended models
We recommend using Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5, and Auto for the best performance.

Enterprise usage
For enterprise customers, browser functionality is managed through toggling availability under MCP controls. Admins have granular controls over each MCP server, as well as over browser access.

Enabling browser for enterprise
To enable browser capabilities for your enterprise team:

Navigate to your Settings Dashboard
Go to MCP Configuration
Toggle "browser features"
Once configured, users in your organization will have access to browser tools based on your MCP allowlist or denylist settings.

Origin allowlist
Enterprise administrators can configure an origin allowlist that restricts which sites the agent can automatically navigate to and where MCP tools can run. This provides granular control over browser access for security and compliance.

Configuration
To configure the origin allowlist:

Navigate to your Admin Dashboard
Go to MCP Configuration
Ensure Enable Browser Automation Features (v2.0+) is enabled
Under Browser Origin Allowlist (v2.1+), click Add Origin
Enter the origins you want to allow (e.g., *, http://localhost:3000, https://internal.example.com)
Leave the allowlist empty to allow all origins. Each origin should be added separately using the Add Origin button.

Behavior
When an origin allowlist is configured:

Automatic navigation: The agent can only use the browser_navigate tool to visit URLs matching origins in the allowlist
MCP tool execution: MCP tools can only run on origins that are in the allowlist
Manual navigation: Users can still manually navigate the browser to any URL, including origins outside the allowlist (useful for viewing documentation or inspecting external sites)
Tool restrictions: Once the browser is on an origin not in the allowlist, browser tools (click, type, navigate) are blocked, even if the user navigated there manually
Edge cases
The origin allowlist provides best-effort protection. Be aware of these behaviors:

Link navigation: If the agent clicks a link on an allowed domain that navigates to a non-allowed origin, the navigation will succeed
Redirects: If the agent navigates to an allowed origin that subsequently redirects to a non-allowed origin, the redirect will be permitted
JavaScript navigation: Client-side navigation (via window.location or similar) from an allowed origin to a non-allowed origin will succeed
