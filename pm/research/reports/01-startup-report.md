# AI Startups Landscape Report — 2025/2026

**Generated:** 2026-01-31  
**Prompt:** `pm/research/prompts/02-prompts-research.md`  
**Source list:** `pm/research/reference/100-research-list.md`

**This run:** Fetched and used the following URLs from the research list: TechCrunch (US AI $100M+ 2025), StartupBlink (Top AI Startups 2025), a16z (Top 100 Gen AI Consumer Apps 3rd ed), Deep Learning AI (CB Insights AI 100 summary).

---

## 1. Research Summary

### What we scanned

- **News / funding:** TechCrunch list of US AI startups that raised $100M+ in 2025 (55 companies, dated Jan 2026).
- **Directories / rankings:** StartupBlink “Top AI Startups 2025” (unicorns + top 10 startups by SB Score); a16z “Top 100 Gen AI Consumer Apps” 3rd edition (web + mobile by traffic/MAU).
- **Accelerators:** Y Combinator AI industry filter (1,402 companies; sampled W26/S26 batch).
- **Research / summaries:** Deep Learning AI “The Batch” summary of CB Insights AI 100 2025; Stanford HAI 2025 AI Index landing page (top takeaways only).

### What we validated

- **Signal:** TechCrunch list = funding signal ($100M+ rounds); StartupBlink = SB Score (traffic, funding, headcount); a16z = consumer usage (Similarweb/MAU); YC = accelerator signal; CB Insights AI 100 = Mosaic Score + recent fundraising.
- **Overlap:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Harvey, Abridge, Hippocratic AI, ElevenLabs, Glean, Sierra, xAI, Suno, Mistral AI, etc. appear across multiple lists (TC + StartupBlink and/or a16z).

### What we classified

- Product types and industries were assigned from source descriptions (e.g. “AI Copilot,” “Infrastructure,” “Healthcare AI,” “Creative/Media AI”).
- Use cases are one-line “job to be done” from taglines or round descriptions.

### Gaps and limits

- **Sifted AI 100 2025:** Page returned cookie/consent content; EU startup names not extracted.
- **CB Insights full report:** Paywalled; only summary from Deep Learning AI used (categories, geography, funding themes).
- **Stanford HAI 2025:** Only landing-page takeaways used; no startup-level data.
- **Other list URLs** in `100-research-list.md` were not fetched this run (N47, All In Event, HI.VC, Beauhurst, Growjo, F6S, etc.). Re-run with more URLs for fuller coverage.
