# Infographic prompt: AI Startup Landscape 2025–2026 (Figma)

**Purpose:** Single brief for designing and populating an infographic from the AI Startups Landscape Report. Use for Figma: artboards, frames, and component specs. No code.  
  
**Brand:** StartupAI — premium, sophisticated, founder-focused.

---

## Design principles (Figma)

- **One section = one frame/artboard** (or a small group of related frames).
- **Components:** Illustrated visual cards (stats, quotes, company examples), flowcharts/diagrams (processes only), chart placeholders (title + caption only; chart type suggested), section headings with clear hierarchy (size, weight, spacing).
- **Tone:** Luxury, high-end UI; avoid generic “AI slop”; strong typography scale, mobile-first responsive.
- **Motion (optional):** Scroll-driven reveals, light entrance/scroll effects only where they add value.
- **Do not design chart internals** — only specify chart title, caption, and type (bar, pie, table, etc.). Data sources are cited in content.

- [ ] Hierarchy: section headings > body > captions; responsive behavior noted.
- [ ] Optional motion/scroll noted only where it adds value (hero, key stats).
- [ ] All copy and stats traceable to `01-startup-report.md`; sources cited in captions or footer.
