# Style guide: AI infographic articles for startup founders

**Benchmark:** [HubSpot AI in GTM Report 2025](https://www.hubspot.com/startups/ai/ai-in-gtm-report-pt1) (Parts 1–3)  
**Audience:** Startup founders (pre-seed to Series B)  
**Goal:** Shorter, scannable, chart-ready articles—less commentary, more signal.

## 1. HubSpot report review (summary)

### What HubSpot does well

| Aspect | HubSpot approach | Why it works for startups |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Structure** | Pt 1 = Benchmarks, Pt 2 = Tools/ROI, Pt 3 = Future/Investment | Clear progression: where we are → how to do it → what’s next |
| **Evidence** | Survey (500 founders, 6 countries, Seed–Series D), named sources (Fathom, Clay, VC quotes) | Relatable; founders trust peer + investor signal |
| **Charts** | One idea per chart; title + short caption; CSV/download | Easy to cite and reuse in decks |
| **Sections** | Executive summary → Intro → Themed sections → Methodology | Skimmable; methodology builds trust |
| **Tone** | “Scale smarter,” “not-so-secret weapon,” “clean slate” | Aspirational but concrete |
| **Use cases** | Tied to GTM (marketing, sales, support) with % and quotes | Directly actionable |

### HubSpot Pt 1–3 (section-level)

**Pt 1 — Benchmark report**  
- **Executive summary:** One narrative hook (e.g. “scale results, not people”) + 3 headlines.  
- **Intro:** 2–3 key stats (e.g. 37% lower CAC, 72% better upsell) + “top AI use cases by ROI” (content 29%, productivity 24%, visual 23%).  
- **Implementation:** Team structure (e.g. 69% have AI lead/team), budget (e.g. 46% put 25%+ of GTM stack in AI), priorities, governance.  
- **Challenges:** Single table (challenge → %); no long commentary.  
- **Global:** Short regional comparisons (NAM vs EMEA vs APAC) with one stat each.  
- **Methodology:** One short block (sample, date, partner).

**Pt 2 — Playbook**  
- **Finding tools:** How startups choose (word-of-mouth vs research) + how they measure ROI.  
- **Case studies:** One paragraph per company (Clay, Rippling, Cyera, Flipsnack); problem → solution → result (e.g. “75% more meetings,” “50% deflection”).  
- **Impact by function:** Marketing / Sales / Service; each gets “top benefits” (with %) and “by industry” or “by stage” where relevant.  
- **Deep case study:** One company (e.g. Fathom) with subheadings (meeting intelligence, handoffs, support, content, trends).

**Pt 3 — Future**  
- **Investment:** “% increased AI investment” + short VC quotes (thesis, what they look for).  
- **Emerging capabilities:** One list (e.g. predictive lead scoring, competitive intel) with % who prioritize.  
- **Talent:** One stat (e.g. 93% plan to hire for AI) + 1–2 internal examples (e.g. HubSpot AI bots).  
- **Predictions:** 2–4 bullets (memory/reasoning, vertical models, data as moat).  
- **Strategy:** 4-step checklist (audit, phased plan, skills, hiring).

### What we do differently

| HubSpot | Our style |
|---------|-----------|
| Long intros and commentary | **Short intro (2–3 sentences)** then into sections |
| Many pull quotes | **1–2 quotes max per article**; rest is summary |
| Three long reports | **One topic per article**; 1–2 pages max |
| Heavy branding / CTAs | **Minimal**; focus on content and sources |
| Broad “future” section | **One clear takeaway** per section |

## 2. Article structure (our default)

Use this for every AI infographic-style article.

1. **Title** — Specific, not generic (e.g. “How Startups Use AI in GTM in 2025” not “AI Report”).  
2. **One-line summary** — What the reader will learn (e.g. “Benchmarks and use cases from 500 founders.”).  
3. **Key stats (chart-ready)** — 3–5 stats in a small table: Metric | Value | Source.  
4. **Sections** — 3–5 sections; each has:
   - **Subtitle** (e.g. “AI adoption by stage”).
   - **1–2 sentence lead** (no fluff).
   - **Bullets or mini-table** (stats, use cases, or examples).
   - **Optional:** one “What this means for founders” line.  
5. **Charts / tables** — Each chart has: Title | 1-line description | Source.  
6. **Sources** — List at end (name + URL); inline “(Source: …)” for key stats.

**Length:** Aim for **1–2 pages** of body text (excluding tables and source list). Prefer bullets and tables over long paragraphs.

## 3. Suggested article topics (for startup founders)

Prioritize topics that are **directly actionable** and **easy to benchmark**.

| # | Topic | Angle | Suggested sections |
|---|--------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | **AI in GTM: benchmarks** | Adoption, spend, team, ROI by stage/ARR | Adoption rates; % of stack that’s AI; top use cases by ROI; challenges (cost, tools, talent) |
| 2 | **AI in sales** | What works (prospecting, CRM, forecasting) | Top benefits by %; by stage; 2–3 short case studies; tools to evaluate |
| 3 | **AI in marketing** | Lead gen, content, personalization | Top benefits; CAC impact; by industry; 1–2 examples |
| 4 | **AI in support** | Deflection, satisfaction, cost | Top benefits; % using AI for 50%+ of interactions; hybrid human/AI pattern |
| 5 | **Choosing AI tools** | How founders decide, ROI metrics | How they find tools (word-of-mouth vs research); how they measure ROI; red flags |
| 6 | **AI team and spend** | Team structure, budget share | Dedicated team vs lead vs none; % of stack; by ARR/stage |
| 7 | **AI and fundraising** | What investors care about | Investor quotes; “AI-savvy” as signal; what to put in the deck |
| 8 | **AI use cases by industry** | Tech vs fintech vs services vs manufacturing | One table: industry → top 2 use cases → 1 stat |
| 9 | **AI mistakes startups make** | What to avoid | Top 3–5 (e.g. wrong tool fit, no governance, no ROI definition); short mitigation |
| 10 | **AI in 2026: what to plan for** | Talent, capabilities, strategy | Hiring for AI; emerging capabilities; 4-step checklist |

**Format:** One article = one topic. Short summary at top, then sections with stats and bullets. Link to HubSpot (and other) sources for depth.

## 4. Style rules (enforce in prompts)

- **Voice:** Second person (“you”) or “founders” / “startups”; avoid “we” unless it’s the research team.  
- **Length:** Max 2–3 sentences per paragraph in body; prefer bullets.  
- **Numbers:** Always cite source; use “%” and “X in Y” for clarity (e.g. “37% say AI lowered CAC”).  
- **Commentary:** No filler (“It’s important to note…”). One “so what” per section max.  
- **Charts:** Every chart has a **title**, **one-line description**, and **source**. Prefer one message per chart.  
- **Quotes:** Use sparingly; 1–2 per article. Prefer summary over long quote.  
- **Jargon:** Avoid or define in one phrase (e.g. “GTM = go-to-market”).  
- **CTAs:** None, or one at end (e.g. “For full data, see [HubSpot Pt 1]”).
