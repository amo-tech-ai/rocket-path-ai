2. **Industries** — Who they serve (use `pm/research/reference/02-industries.md`).

## What to deliver

- **Stats for charts** — Counts and % (e.g. by type, industry, use case). Source every number.
- **Tables** — e.g. startup | type | industry | use case | source.
- **Short qualitative notes** — Why it matters for founders (1–2 sentences).
- **Infographic sections** — One block per topic (types, industries, features, use cases, examples) with a short description and 1–2 chart ideas.
- **Top AI use cases** — Ranked list or chart-ready table with source.

## Steps

1. Scan sources from `100-research-list.md` (news, directories, accelerator lists).
2. Extract and classify startups (type, industry, use case); deduplicate.
3. Count and summarize (%, counts) for charts; note sources.
4. Draft infographic sections and chart captions; keep copy short and relatable.

## Style

- Clear, logical, easy to understand.
- Every stat has a source.
- Infographic copy = short descriptions founders can relate to.
